			<h2 class="heading">The Process of Initiation</h2>
			<P>When children are five years old and attain some awareness, the parents, brothers, sisters or any guardian may initiate them in Náma Mantra [the preliminary process of meditation]. They should be taught to sit in padmásana [lotus posture], but instead of interlocking the fingers, they may rest one palm upon the other; and keep the spine erect. They will then be instructed to feel or imagine that everything around them, and whatever they visualize, is Brahma.</P>
			
			<P>After this, at the age of twelve, the child should take initiation from an ácárya/á in Sádhárańa Yoga, and at sixteen or afterwards, they should take initiation in Sahaja Yoga from the ácárya/á. If considered essential, ásanas may be taught before the age of sixteen.</P>
			
			<P>The [purodhás] may consider imparting lessons in Visheśa Yoga to some of the initiates who are adept in Sahaja Yoga, who have an ardent desire to learn this higher yoga, and who can afford to devote sufficient time every day for the same.</P>
			
			<P>The ácárya/ás or purodhás will not take any remuneration from their initiates for initiation. It is the duty of every Ananda Margi to help maintain the financial security of the ácárya/ás and purodhás.</P>
			
			<P>A person of twelve or above may only be initiated by an ácárya/á, a táttvika, or a dharmamitram. No fee is to be charged for this initiation. The process of dakśińá [offering to the master] is the same in Náma Mantra as it is in Prárambhika,Sádhárańa and Sahaja Yoga. In Náma Mantra there is no process of shuddhis [withdrawal of the mind] or repetition of mantra by syllables.</P>
			
			<P>Arrangements have to be made so that those who are initiated in Náma Mantra can also learn gradually the lessons of Yama and Niyama. As far as possible it is preferable not to initiate more than one person at a time in Náma Mantra. Náma Mantra should not be taught to more than four persons at a time.</P>
			
			<P>Naming the Initiated Person</P>
			
			<P>At the time of initiation or shortly afterwards, those who do not have a Sanskrit name should be given one by the ácárya/á. The word deva should be suffixed to the name. Every person is at liberty to use his/her own surname, but the more the usage of deva as a title, the better it is. The Sanskrit name should be used in all worldly dealings. Even when the naming is done in Sanskrit, you will give equal respect and full scope to all languages.</P>
			
			<P>Diikśádána [Initiation]</P>
			
			<P>(1) Only a few selected individuals will be initiated into the difficult Visheśa Yoga. Purodhás alone are entitled to give this initiation.</P>
			
			<P>(2) Those who are deserving and have an earnest desire will be initiated in Sahaja Yoga. Ácárya/ás alone are entitled to initiate them.</P>
			
			<P>(3) The ácárya/á will impart training only in Sádhárańa Yoga to those persons for whom the practice of Sahaja Yoga is inconvenient, or who for any other reason are unable to practise it. In Sádhárańa Yoga there is no restriction of diet, because ásanas are excluded from this course.</P>
			
			<P>(4) The ácárya/á will impart training in Prárambhika Yoga to those for whom Sádhárańa Yoga is inconvenient. In Prárambhika Yoga, too, there are no ásanas, therefore there are no dietary restrictions. Those who have an earnest desire to practise ásanas or who need to practise ásanas for physical or mental reasons, can be imparted training in ásanas by the ácárya/á, even along with Prárambhika Yoga, if the ácárya/á so pleases. If the ácárya/á has little time at his/her disposal, he/she will impart training in Prárambhika Yoga in the beginning even to those with developed saḿskáras [mental reactive momenta]. Later, on getting adequate proof of the initiate’s worth, the ácárya/á will train him/her in Sádhárańa Yoga or Sahaja Yoga.</P>
			
			<P>(5) Initiation in Prárambhika, Sádhárańa and, in special cases, Sahaja Yoga will be done before the pratiika [emblem].</P>

			<h2 class="heading">Sádhaná</h2>
			<p>The goal of sádhaná [spiritual practice] is the all-round elevation of human beings. Spiritual practices do not teach renunciation of the world, they teach only the proper utilization of the subtle and crude potentialities. Just as it is necessary to follow a suitable system in the social and economic spheres, in exactly the same manner it is necessary to advance scientifically with proper discipline in the physical and mental spheres.</p>
			<p>To develop a healthy body and mind, the following items must be strictly followed:</p>
			<p>(1) Yama Sádhaná and (2) Niyama Sádhaná.</p> 
			<p>Special instructions regarding the items of Yama and Niyama should be learned from an ácárya/á. In fact, the principles of Yama and Niyama perfectly illustrate how one should deal with the surrounding world.</p>
			<p>The potentiality of an ideal humanity is inherent in Yama and Niyama. Those who are established in Yama and Niyama attain emancipation from the aśt́apásha and śad́aripu(2) arising from Avidyá [the extroversial force]. In this connection it is important to remember that overcoming the aśt́apásha and śad́aripu is not the same as eliminating them. In order to survive, one will have to maintain these páshas and ripus, but you should not be subservient to them, rather they should be subservient to you.</p>
			<p>(3) Ásana. Ásanas are postures in which one can remain in physical comfort and psychic composure. The practice of ásanas cures the body’s glandular system of all its maladies and helps the mind to attain balance for spiritual practices. Ásanas should be practised only after obtaining instructions from an ácárya/á.</p>
			<p>(4) Práńáyáma. There is an inseparable relationship between the váyus of the body [ten basic energy flows] and the mind. Unsteadiness of respiration means unsteadiness of mind and vice versa. Práńáyáma is the scientific process to control respiration and hence the mind, as a result of which sádhaná is especially facilitated.</p>
			<p>The practice of dhyána [meditation in which the psyche is directed towards Consciousness] becomes a time-consuming affair if práńáyáma is not adequately practised. Práńáyáma must be learned from an ácárya/á, otherwise it may be harmful.</p>
			<p>(5) Pratyáhára. Pratyáhára literally means “withdrawal” - withdrawing the unsteady mind from the allurement of particular objects. Varńárghyadána [Guru Pújá], offering the colours of the mind to Márga Guru, is the simplest means for withdrawal, but this process of pratyáhára can be practised even if Márga Guru is not present in His physical form. Ácárya/ás will give training in pratyáhára.</p>
			<p>(6) Dhárańá. Dhárańá is concentrating the citta [objective mind, mind-stuff] on prescribed points. Ácárya/ás will teach this process to eligible persons.</p>
			<p>(7) Dhyána. Dhyána is the unbroken flow of the mind-stuff, or citta, in one continuous stream, like the flow of oil, where all the propensities of the mind are fixed on the goal.</p>
			<p>(8) Samádhi. The state in which the tendencies of the mind are completely suspended following the practice of dhyána is called nirvikalpa samádhi.</p>
			<p>Though in the samádhi attained through the practice of Iishvara prańidhána the “I” feeling as well as the mental propensities are not totally suspended, one becomes ensconced in the Cosmic stance. The jiiva [unit] gets established in Infinity. This state is called savikalpa samádhi.</p>

			<h2 class="heading">Táttvika, Ácárya/á, and Purodhá</h2>
			<p>(1) Only those persons who are sincere, spirited and endowed with sharp intellect; and who understand and can make others understand the philosophy; will be considered eligible to become ácárya/ás.</p>
			<p>(2) Ácárya/ás who have a minimum of five hundred initiates and are adept in the difficult Visheśa Yoga will be eligible for purodhá training.</p>
			<p>(3) Those who can inspire at least twenty persons (five persons in special cases) onto the path of spirituality may be imparted táttvika training.</p>
			<p>(4) As far as possible, only purodhás will be elected or nominated for any responsible post of the Marga.</p>
			<p>Keeping in view that the ideals of the Marga are to be propagated universally, these rules may at times be relaxed with the consent of the Central Committee and with the approval of the purodhá pramukha.</p>

			<h2 class="heading">Self-Analysis</h2>
			<p>If an Ananda Margi violates the principles of Yama and Niyama, he/she will confess his/her fault to any ácárya/á and ask for punishment, on that day or on the day of the next dharmacakra.</p>
			<p>The ácárya/á will prescribe only physical or mental punishment, not financial or any other type of punishment, to those at fault.</p>
			<p>The ácárya/ás will prescribe punishment in the form of service to the society, but they will never accept any kind of service for themselves from the persons at fault.</p>
			<p>If rectification of one’s offence is possible, the ácárya/á will, instead of giving punishment outright, have the fault rectified by the guilty person by other appropriate means and ask him/her to be careful in the future. If the offence is serious, the ácárya/á may punish publicly, but the nature of the fault will not be disclosed.</p>
			<p>Whether one’s conduct has been defective or not, a statement regarding how far the principles of Yama and Niyama have been followed has to be submitted to the ácárya/á (here ácárya/á means any ácárya/á). In this connection, the date of the previous report should be kept in mind.</p>

			<h2 class="heading">Relationship with an Ácárya/á</h2>
			<p>In the absence of any previous relationship, and depending upon their respective ages, the relationship between the ácárya/á and the initiate will be that of an elder brother/sister and a younger brother/sister. In case the initiate is younger in age, he/she may greet the ácárya/á by touching the ácárya/á’s feet. Even if the ácárya/á is younger in age, initiates may touch the ácárya/á’s feet in greeting if they wish. The initiate must not do sáśt́áuṋga prańáma(1) to the ácárya/á. These rules apply among fellow disciples also. The ácárya/á should always be addressed in respectful language.</p>
			<p>1956, Jamalpur</p>

		<div ng-show="bookPageIndex == 7">
			<h2 class="heading">Methods of Salutation</h2>
			<p>There are three methods of salutation: (1) sáśt́áuṋga prańáma [prostration], (2) carańa sparsha prańáma [bowing and touching the feet] and (3) namaskára [salutation].</p>
			<p>Sáśt́áuṋga prańáma: Sáśt́áuṋga prańáma is a symbol of simplicity. It is to be done only to Márga Guru. It signifies surrender to the ideology. Women can do salutation by touching the ground with the forehead instead of full prostration.</p>
			<p>Carańa sparsha prańáma: Carańa sparsha prańáma means to touch the feet of a revered person with one’s hands and then to touch one’s forehead with those same hands. This prańáma should be done only to those who command high regard from the worldly or spiritual viewpoint. As far as possible, do not do carańa sparsha prańáma except to persons such as these. Never do carańa sparsha prańáma to people whom you do not regard, whoever they may be.</p>
			<p>Namaskára: Namaskára is done by bringing the palms together and touching the ájiṋá cakra [the mid-point of the eyebrows] with the thumbs, without bowing. It can be done to all regardless of their age, because this mode of salutation is used with the ideation that everyone is the manifestation of the Supreme Being.</p>
			<p>Do not shake hands with anyone, because it is unhygienic, and do not do kurnish [a kind of court salute signifying submission to one’s authority] to anyone, as you are not anyone’s slave. Kurnish is a symbol of slavery, so as a form of salutation it is strictly forbidden.</p>

			<h2 class="heading">Páiṋcajanya</h2>
			<p>At five o’clock every morning, sádhakas [spiritual aspirants] will assemble at a jágrti, and where there is no jágrti, at a fixed convenient place, and participate in singing five minutes of Prabháta Saḿgiita, in performing fifteen minutes of kiirtana, and lastly in performing ten minutes of collective meditation. This should be the practice on all days of the week except Sundays. On Sundays, there should be singing of ten minutes of Prabháta Saḿgiita, performance of fifteen minutes of kiirtana, and performance of at least ten minutes of collective meditation. This programme is known as páiṋcajanya.</p>

			<h2 class="heading">Dharmacakra</h2>
			<p>Dharmacakra is a congregation of spiritual aspirants for collective performance of Iishvara Prańidhána and spiritual discussions. All will sit in rows adjacent to each other. Women and men will sit in separate rows. Anyone joining dharmacakra (after Iishvara Prańidhána has started) will silently occupy a suitable seat in proper order.</p>
			<p>Iishvara Prańidhána should be performed at a scheduled time. After the expiry of the time of Iishvara Prańidhána fixed by an ácárya/á, as soon as the signal is given, everyone (including those still in meditation) should be ready to join the collective meeting.</p>
			<p>The following mantra will be recited three times at the beginning of Iishvara Prańidhána:</p>
			<p>
				<span>Saḿgacchadhvaḿ saḿvadadhvaḿ saḿ vo manáḿsi jánatám,</span>
				<span>Devábhágaḿ yathápúrve saḿjánáná upásate.</span>
				<span>Samánii va ákútih samáná hrdayánivah,</span>
				<span>Samánamastu vo mano yathá vah susahásati.</span>
			</p>
			<p>[Let us move together, let us radiate the same thought-wave, let us come to know our minds together,</p>
			<p>Let us share our wealth without differentiation, like sages of the past, so that all may enjoy the universe.</p>
			<p>Let our aspirations be united, let our hearts be inseparable,</p>
			<p>Let our minds be as one mind, so that we live in harmony and become one with the Supreme.]</p>
			<p>Directions</p>
			<p>(1) Dharmacakra should be organized every Sunday at a time directed by the local ácárya/á. On festival days also, dharmacakra may be held.</p>
			<p>(2) When in good health, one must participate in the weekly dharmacakra. In case one is unable to attend the dharmacakra at the appointed time due to involvement in governmental duties or service to patients, one should go to the jágrti any time that day and perform Iishvara Prańidhána. If even that is not possible, one should completely forgo one principal meal at the end of that week.</p>
			<p>(3) In dharmacakra everybody will sit on common seats and wear clothes acceptable to the society.</p>
			<p>(4) Non-Margis having an ardent spiritual longing may attend dharmacakra as a spectator or audience. In that case they will have to make known their intentions and obtain prior permission of the jágrti manager. Only Ananda Margis are entitled to ask or answer questions at dharmacakra. It is the exclusive prerogative of the jágrti manager to allow or disallow a non-Margi to be present at dharmacakra. Tattvasabhá [spiritual conference] should be arranged for the convenience of spiritually inquisitive non-Margiis.</p>

			<p>You shall not take into account the dates and stars while setting out on a journey. You may, as necessary, set out for your destination after ascribing Brahma-hood to your journey through guru mantra. If you are to consult the dates and stars at every step, you are to carry an almanac with you all the time – something which is truly contrary to nature.</p>

			<h2 class="heading">Marriage Ceremony</h2>
			<p>The marriage premises and the marriage hall should be artistically decorated within one’s economic means. If possible the courtyard of the house should be kept vibrant with music. The pratiika [emblem of Bliss] should be placed in an elevated place in the marriage hall. Incense may be burnt at the time of the marriage. During the solemnization of the marriage at least ten persons should be present. The bride and the bridegroom, dressed in neat and appropriate clothing, will enter the marriage hall and sit facing each other. The persons present should greet them by blowing the conch or by other auspicious sounds. As directed by the ácárya/á, collective Iishvara Prańidhána will be done.</p>
			<p>Two ácárya/ás (one on the groom’s side and the other on the bride’s side) will officiate. If two ácárya/ás are not available, one can officiate. In the absence of any ácárya/á, the seniormost Margi present will officiate.</p>
			<p>Marriage Solemnization</p>
			<p>First the ácárya/á will recite:</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oṋḿ madhu vátá rtáyate madhu kśarantu sindhavah;</span>
				<span>Mádhviirnah santvośadhiih.</span>

				<span>Oṋḿ madhu oṋḿ madhu oṋḿ madhu.</span>
			</p>
			<p>Following the ácárya/á, the bridegroom will repeat, “I say on oath in the name of Parama Brahma and Márga Gurudeva that out of my own free will I accept Shriimatii/Ms. . . . . . . . as my wife. I take upon myself all the responsibility for her food, clothes, education, medical care, etc., from today.”</p>
			<p>Then the ácárya/á will recite:</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oṋḿ madhu vátá rtáyate madhu kśarantu sindhavah;</span>
				<span>Mádhviirnah santvośadhiih.</span>

			</p>
			<p>Then the bride will say, “I say on oath in the name of Parama Brahma and Márga Gurudeva that out of my own free will I accept Shrii/Mr. . . . . . . . as my husband. I take upon myself all the responsibility to look after his family life from today.”</p>
			<p>Thereafter the ácárya/á will again recite:</p>

			</p>
			<p>Then the bridegroom will say, “I say on oath in the name of Parama Brahma and Márga Gurudeva that out of my own free will I accept Shriimatii/Ms. . . . . . . . as my wife. I will be vigilant in every way to safeguard her mental peace and ensure her mental progress from today.”</p>
			<p>The ácárya/á will then recite:</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oṋḿ madhu vátá rtáyate madhu kśarantu sindhavah;</span>

			</p>
			<p>Then, the bridegroom will say, “I say on oath in the name of Parama Brahma and Márga Gurudeva that I accept Shriimati/Ms. . . . . . . . as my wife. I will be vigilant in every way to ensure her spiritual progress from today.”</p>
			<p>Then the ácárya/á will recite:</p>

			<p>Then the bride will say, “I say on oath in the name of Parama Brahma and Márga Gurudeva that I accept Shrii/Mr. . . . . . . . as my husband. I will be vigilant in every way to ensure his spiritual progress from today.”</p>
			<p>Those present, [[at least ten persons,]] led by the ácárya/á, will repeat, “We say on oath in the name of Parama Brahma and Márga Gurudeva that we are witnesses to this wedding. By the grace of all-merciful Brahma, may we be helpful to the best of our capacity for the all-round progress of this newly-married couple.”</p>
			<p>Thereafter the newly-married couple will garland each other and exchange the garlands three times. In the absence of garlands, they may exchange flowers. According to custom, the bridegroom may put a vermilion mark in the parting of the hair of the bride three times, and the bride may put a vermilion mark on the forehead of the bridegroom.</p>
			<p>The newly-married couple will hold each other’s hands. A conch may be blown and other auspicious sounds may be made. If possible, arrangement may also be made for vocal and instrumental music. The newly-married couple will do prańáma [salutations] to the ácárya/ás and to their parents or guardians.</p>
			<p>A marriage feast is completely optional and depends upon the financial capacity of the people concerned. Arranging the feast by taking a loan or incurring a debt is prohibited.</p>
			<p>A Few Instructions:</p>
			<p>(1) While arranging a marriage [in the case of that kind of marriage], the guardians should not consider the caste or nationality of the bride and bridegroom, but they must consider the family and the merits and demerits of the two. The guardians, before fixing the marriage, will seek the opinions of the bride and the bridegroom and proceed accordingly. The guardians should not allow matrimony between persons connected with each other either on the paternal or the maternal side for three generations, ascending or descending.</p>
			<p>(2) In the case of arranged marriages, the guardians should finally meet and ascertain the consent of the bride and bridegroom, and bless them, at least a day before the marriage is solemnized.</p>
			<p>(3) If the boy and the girl settle their marriage themselves, it is proper for the guardians to give their consent. In case the guardians feel that the consequences of such a marriage will be harmful, they may ask the boy and the girl to reconsider their decision. Even then, if they do not change their opinion, the guardians will give their consent, but they will be in no way responsible for such a marriage.</p>
			<p>(4) Every person should marry if there is not sufficient reason against marriage. A decision for marriage should be taken with full consideration of one’s physical, mental, and financial conditions and environmental circumstances. No one should exert pressure in the matter of marriage. [[According to Bliss,]] marriage is not a hindrance to dharma sádhaná; rather, marriage is a dhármika ceremony.</p>
			<p>(5) Male members of the Marga can marry females outside the Marga, but it will be better to marry a female member of the Marga to a male member of the Marga, as far as possible. If a suitable match is available outside the Marga, the marriage may be solemnized, but efforts should be made to initiate him into the Marga without delay.</p>
			<p>(6) For marriage, neither party can demand a dowry.</p>
			<p>(7) A widow or a woman forsaken by her husband can remarry. A man marrying such a woman will be given a special status in the society. He will have to shoulder the responsibility of bringing up the children by her previous husband.</p>
			<p>(8) If a woman forsaken by the society desires to lead an honourable life, proper opportunities should be afforded to her. If anyone marries such a woman in the manner prescribed by the Marga, the marriage should be properly respected.</p>
			<p>(9) Men can prove their manliness by marrying shelterless women. Do not at all allow a woman to live [[in neglect]].</p>
			<p>(10) It is proper not to marry again when one’s wife is alive. But sometimes, due to social or family necessity,(3) more than one marriage can be accepted. If there is a need of more than one marriage, the clear permission of the wife has to be obtained in the presence of five responsible persons (one of whom will preferably be an ácárya/á). The second marriage will not be permissible without the permission of the wife. These five persons will specifically ascertain the veracity of the statement of the petitioner.</p>
			<p>(11) In Bliss no one will be looked down upon as an illegitimate child. In such circumstances, the parents of the child will be compelled to marry in the prescribed manner, and if need be, the man will have to agree to more than one marriage.</p>
			<p>In order that the dignity of a child born out of wedlock may be saved, it will not be necessary to take the permission of the earlier wife for the marriage.</p>
			<p>(12) The mantras in the Bliss marriage system are such that the question of divorce does not arise; but in very extraordinary circumstances, on charges of characterlessness, irresponsibility, or cruelty, divorce may be accepted. The complainant (man or woman) will appeal to five important responsible persons of the Marga (an ácárya/á preferably being one of them). On being satisfied regarding the validity of the complaint, they will allow the complainant six months’ time for reconsideration. If the petition is still not withdrawn and the reasons for the complaint remain unaltered, divorce will be accepted. In this connection, the procedure for the division of the properties will be formulated according to the demands of the time.</p>

			<h2 class="heading">The Ideal Householder</h2>
			<p>An ideal householder should try to provide food for the maximum number of human beings and animals.</p>
			<p>Disadvantaged persons and guests: Do not remain indifferent to the service of disadvantaged persons and guests. Do not consider their lineage, culture, or religious beliefs while serving them.</p>
			<p>Service to animals: Milk-giving animals should be properly respected and looked after like human mothers. Even after an animal loses her ability to give milk, do not harm or kill her.</p>
			<p>Beggars: The best way to serve beggars is to feed them. If cooked food is not ready in the house, give food items (cereals, pulses, or any vegetables). If necessary, also arrange for their medical treatment, clothing, or accommodation, because as long as the beggar problem persists and the state does not shoulder the responsibility of solving it, the householders will have to bear this responsibility. Begging should not be encouraged, but arrangements will have to be made so that those who are genuinely distressed do not die of starvation. Do not give cash to a beggar, for this will encourage others to adopt the practice of begging.</p>
			<p>Sadávrata: The type of public charity that every sádhaka should undertake as an individual or that sádhakas undertake as a family or as a community will be known as sadávrata.</p>

			<p>Then, in the afternoon, all will perform collective Iishvara Prańidhána and Varńárghyadána (using áviir [coloured powder] or flowers of colours of their own choice). At the end, all will play among themselves with this áviir or these flowers without distinction between young and old, initiate and ácárya. Do not offer these colours or flowers at anybody’s feet. But if, while people are playing, they do touch anybody’s feet, that should not be considered wrong, in Ánandamúrtijii’s opinion. (Men and women should not exchange colours and flowers with each other.) Finally, there will be a collective meal.</p>
			<p>The following day, continue merry celebrations at your residence and have a procession with táńd́ava dance in the afternoon. Continue collective merry celebrations in the evening.</p>
			<p>Our social-cum-spiritual functions will be considered part of spiritual life.</p>
			<p>N.B.:</p>
			<p>•	Programmes should be conveniently arranged and adjusted if necessary. </p>
			<p>•	In relation to Guru Pújá, one should remember that both crude and subtle offerings have equal value. Therefore one should not do anything merely for show. </p>
			<p>•	In all family celebrations, perform collective Iishvara Prańidhána. Dharmacakra should be arranged in all social functions, and spiritual discourses may also be arranged, according to convenience. </p>

			<h2 class="heading">The System of Invitation</h2>
			<p>The head of a family, or the spouse, or their brothers/sisters, or in their absence the sons and daughters, are the proper representatives of a family to invite their guests. As far as possible, the invitation should be extended at a person’s residence. If the inviter happens to meet the person to be invited outside the latter’s residence, the invitation can be delivered then and there.</p>
			<p>If someone desires to offer gifts in response to an invitation, the best gifts are flowers, but even flowers are not essential. If someone has an intense desire to offer a special present, it should be done either in the absence of the other invited guests or on some other day, otherwise it will be considered an antisocial act.</p>

		</div>
		<div ng-show="bookPageIndex == 23">
			<h2 class="heading">Dress</h2>
			<p>You should wear dress according to your own preference and convenience. It is proper to always wear clean clothes so that others do not unnecessarily form a poor impression about you.</p>
			<p>While going out of their house, women should wear simple and decent clothes and cover their bodies properly. Dress norms for women may be slightly relaxed during festivals, or when they are accompanied by male guardians, or when good security arrangements have been made. The same norms apply to the wearing of ornaments also.</p>

		<div ng-show="bookPageIndex == 24">
			<h2 class="heading">Social Relationship between Men and Women</h2>
			<p>Men and women are human beings having equal dignity. As the physical strength of women is less than that of men, the latter should always endeavour to save the prestige of women. As the mothers of men, women can claim this much as a right. Special attention should be paid to the comforts of women during festivals, at spiritual conferences, and on other occasions.</p>
			<p>When necessary, men and women can mix together, sit next to one another and participate in meetings and conferences, but they should not engage in gossip as its results are not beneficial. It should be remembered that a woman’s friend is a woman and a man’s friend is a man. The more distant the relationship between men and women, the greater should be the courtesy maintained in mutual conversation and behaviour between them.</p>
			<p>It is proper to address a woman not related to one’s family as “Mother”. But where such an address sounds unpleasant to the ears, one should use respectful words such as “Sister”, “Daughter” and the like. Unrelated men and women should not touch one another as far as possible, except during illness or in special circumstances (during salutation, administering medical care, etc.).</p>
			<p>Except for professional actors and actresses, men and women should not jointly participate in theatrical performances. Under special circumstances this rule may be relaxed for faultless characters, with the permission of a purodhá.</p>
			<p>An ácárya/á or a purodhá cannot actively participate in any acting, but individually they can cultivate the fine arts. An ácárya/á can even act in special cases or in special dramas with the permission of a purodhá.</p>

		<div ng-show="bookPageIndex == 25">
			<h2 class="heading">Livelihood</h2>
			<p>You can adopt any honest livelihood to maintain yourself and your family. To live on food given by others is a great humiliation. You must endeavour to spend a minimum of one-fiftieth of your income on public service. Spending one’s entire earnings on oneself and one’s direct family will gradually lead to crudeness. No one should utilize fine arts for material benefits; but in case of extreme financial hardship of a family, the rigidity of this rule may be temporarily relaxed after consulting the concerned ácárya/á.</p>
			<p>1956, Jamalpur</p>
		</div>
		<div ng-show="bookPageIndex == 26">
			<h2 class="heading">The Livelihood of Women</h2>
			<p>Where appropriate, women should take on the responsibility of weaving, sewing, cattle-rearing and light agricultural work. Generally it is desirable for women to earn an honest livelihood remaining at home. If it is not possible to maintain the family in this way, women may find employment in more physically strenuous work such as government service, business, etc., outside the home. No one should be conservative or superstitious in this regard.</p>

			<h2 class="heading">Economic Policy</h2>
			<p>You should always remember that you are members of a joint family, so you should unitedly utilize all the property of the universe. Remember, you have direct or indirect responsibility for every child and every human being in the society, so do not try to keep yourself aloof from others. Those who do not utilize, or misuse, the wealth of the universe deliberately ignore the Cosmic Father, because they want to deprive His other children, that is, their own brothers and sisters, of their legitimate share. In fact, these people are all victims of psychic ailments. You should try to bring all such social exploiters to the path of honesty by means of mental and spiritual education. In case you fail in this attempt, force them to follow a virtuous path by creating circumstantial pressure, and give them spiritual guidance to permanently eradicate their psychic diseases. You should always remember that this sort of rectification is impossible unless you have genuine love for humanity.</p>

			<h2 class="heading">Ideal System of Inheritance</h2>
			<p>The system of inheritance should ordinarily be as follows:</p>
			<p>(1) Sons and daughters will inherit in equal shares the movable and/or immovable property of their parents. The daughter will enjoy the immovable property during her lifetime, but will not have the right to transfer it to others. The property will revert to her father’s family after her death.</p>
			<p>(2) The widow will inherit the entire property of her husband, and the property of her father-in-law and mother-in-law, in equal share with her brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law. She will not have the right to transfer the immovable properties inherited from her husband or parents-in-law. In case she remarries or dies, that immovable property will devolve to her sons and daughters, and in their absence, to her husband’s brothers and sisters, and in their absence, to the descendants of her husband’s brothers. In the absence of her husband’s brothers or their descendants, the widow will have every right to utilize that property – including the right of transfer – in any way she likes. In case she re-marries, she will forfeit the right to that property. In this case, the property will revert to the nearest relation of her father-in-law.</p>
			<p>(3) In case a widow remarries and keeps the minor children by her previous husband with her, she can look after the paternal properties of those children as their de facto guardian, but in no case will her new husband (or the children by her new husband) have any claim to that property. If the children by her previous husband desire to remain in their father’s family, in that case the nearest relation of their father will be entrusted with the charge of looking after the property.</p>
			<p>(4) The movable and/or immovable property acquired by a woman herself will be shared equally by all her sons and daughters (regardless of who their father is). Presents, ornaments, or other materials received during her marriage, or anything movable or immovable offered to her as gifts, will be considered as her self-acquired property.</p>
			<p>(5) A woman who has divorced her husband will have no right to his property. The financial burden for the bringing up of the children of that woman rests with their father (and those children are also the inheritors of their paternal property). However, she can keep the children by her former husband with her as long as she pleases. At that time also, her divorced husband will have the financial responsibility to maintain those children.</p>
			<p>In case a woman remarries and wants to keep the children by her previous husband with her, whether she can do so depends on whether or not the previous husband gives permission. In the event that the previous husband agrees to her being the custodian of his children after her remarriage, he will not be financially liable for the maintenance of the children.</p>
			<p>(6) The property of one family usually will not pass on to the family of the married daughter except by will or by gift. But if the daughter has no brother or his descendants, she will have the absolute right to that property, including the right of transfer. After her demise, her sons and daughters will inherit the self-acquired property of their mother.</p>
			<p>(7) The property of an unmarried person or childless couple will pass on to their nearest relation(s).</p>
			<p>(8) If necessary, you shall amend the system of inheritance according to the demands of the age.</p>

			<h2 class="heading">Social Punishment</h2>
			<p>Anybody having committed an antisocial act will have to undergo a severe fast or punishment of any other type prescibed by an ácárya/á for the atonement of the sin. Only the person at fault – not any other member of his/her family – will be penalized. As soon as one’s defect is rectified, the punishment should be withdrawn. If the person undergoing atonement inspires ten people onto the path of spirituality, the defect will be considered expiated.</p>
			<p>If there is any allegation against the conduct of any Ananda Margi, it must be brought to the notice of the ácárya/á; and in the ácárya/á’s absence, to the notice of the other ácárya/á who has taken the responsibility of further guiding the accused Margi regarding spiritual practices. If the second ácárya/á is not easily available, the matter should be brought to the notice of the upabhukti pramukha or the general bhukti pradhána(1) concerned. Then, within a week, these persons will form a tribunal consisting only of ácárya/ás to investigate the matter. If the allegation is proved true, the tribunal will decide the proper punishment for the accused. If the accused so desires, he/she can, with the permission of the members of the tribunal, appeal against the judgement of the tribunal to the general bhukti pradhána. The bhukti pradhána will then form another tribunal consisting of ácárya/ás. If even then the accused is not satisfied with the judgement of the tribunal constituted by the bhukti pradhána, he/she may, with the permission of the members of the second tribunal, appeal to the general secretary of the Saḿgha. In that case, the decision taken by the general secretary or by the tribunal appointed by the general secretary will be taken to be final.</p>
			<p>In case the accused is a family ácárya/á, the allegations must be brought to the notice of the secretary, Central Ácárya Board. The secretary will then constitute a tribunal, and, if the allegations are proved true, the tribunal will decide the punishment.</p>
			<p>In case the accused is a non-ácárya/á wholetimer of any wing of Bliss, the allegations will have to be brought to the notice of the concerned head of that wing of Bliss. The latter will then appoint a tribunal, and, if the allegation is proved true, the tribunal will decide the punishment.</p>
			<p>In case the accused wholetimer is an ácárya/á, the allegations will have to be directly brought to the notice of the secretary of the Central Ácárya Board, or to the head of that wing of Bliss. Then the secretary of the Board or the wing-head concerned will form a tribunal for investigation, and, if the allegation is proved true, the tribunal will decide the punishment.</p>
			<p>In case the allegation is against any wing-head, it will have to be brought to the notice of the general secretary of the Saḿgha. [The general secretary will take a decision in this matter by himself or through his appointed tribunal, as he wishes.]</p>
			<p>N.B.:</p> 
			<p>•	It is not desirable that the tribunal should consist of more than three persons.</p> 
			<p>•	Allegations will always have to be submitted in writing. </p>
			<p>•	In case the allegations are proved false, the complainant will have to accept the same punishment which the accused would have received had the allegations brought against him/her proved true. </p>

			<h2 class="heading">Disposal of the Dead Body</h2>
			<p>According to the wish of the individual, the dead body may be either cremated or buried. If a person did not express his/her desire during life regarding this, it is proper to cremate his/her dead body.</p>
			<p>Instructions:</p>
			<p>(1) The dead body should be carried silently.</p>
			<p>(2) Before cremation or burial of the dead body, collective Iishvara Prańidhána should be performed.</p>
			<p>(3) The funeral pyre should be lit by the laokika [worldly] son or the nearest relation of the dead person. Likewise, while burying, the son or the nearest relation will first dig the ground and also be the first one to put earth on the corpse.</p>
			<p>(4) During cremation, it should be remembered that the corpse should be thoroughly burnt, maintaining the full dignity of the dead body. In case of a half-burnt corpse, it is better to bury it than to throw it into water.</p>
			<p>(5) The disposal of the dead body and its financial responsibility belong to the society. It is not proper to give any burden to the bereaved family.</p>
			<p>N.B.:</p>
			<p>It is better to cremate the dead body in a scientific way. Where this is not possible, do not cremate the dead body naked or in an offensive manner, for that will undermine the dignity and sanctity of the funeral ceremony and produce feelings of repugnance in the onlookers. As the practice of putting fire into the mouth of the dead body is repulsive, it should not be encouraged.</p>

			<h2 class="heading">Shráddha Ceremony</h2>
			<p>N.B.: The departed soul does not get any advantage from the shráddha ceremony [memorial ceremony]. It is only meant for the psychic satisfaction of the person performing it.</p>
			<p>An ácárya/á, a minimum of five healthy persons, and the performer of the shráddha will be present on the occasion. The nearest relation of the dead person will be considered the main performer of the shráddha ceremony. Of course, it is the right of all Margis to perform shráddha.</p>
			<p>(1) Everyone in the ceremony will follow the ácárya/á in reciting the following mantra:</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oṋḿ madhu vátá rtáyate madhu kśarantu sindhavah;</span>
				<span>Mádhviirnah santvośadhiih.</span>
				<span>Madhu naktamutośaso madhumat párthivaḿ rajah;</span>
				<span>Madhu dyaorastu nah pitá.</span>

				<span>Mádhviirgávo bhavantu nah.</span>
				<span>Oṋḿ madhu oṋḿ madhu oṋḿ madhu. (One time.)</span>
			</p>
			<p>(2) “O Supreme Father, the incorporeal soul of our dearest Shrii/Shriimatii (Mr./Ms.) . . . . . . . is far, far beyond this mortal world today. O Supreme Being, may his/her immortal soul attain higher and higher manifestation.” (Three times.)</p>
			<p>(3) “O Supreme Father, our dearest Shrii/Shriimatii (Mr./Ms.) . . . . . . . attains liberation today from the bondages of all worldly duties. May his/her immortal soul attain eternal peace this day under the sole control of Your sweet will.” (Three times.)</p>
			<p>(4) “O Supreme Father, You have freed us today from all the social responsibility we bore towards our dearest Shrii/Shriimatii (Mr./Ms.) . . . . . . . We return Your son/daughter to Your gracious lap with all the purity of our hearts. Oblige us by accepting him/her who is Yours.” (Three times.)</p>
			<p>(5) “O Supreme Father, may those of Your children who are separated from Your loving lap and subjected to the triple afflictions of mundane life,(13) be not deprived of Your loving shelter at the end of their earthly sojourn.” (Three times.)</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oṋḿ madhu vátá rtáyate madhu kśarantu sindhavah;</span>
				<span>Mádhviirnah santvośadhiih.</span>
				<span>Madhu naktamutośaso madhumat párthivaḿ rajah;</span>
				<span>Madhu dyaorastu nah pitá.</span>
				<span>Madhumán no vanaspatirmadhumán astu súryah;</span>
				<span>Mádhviirgávo bhavantu nah.</span>
				<span>Oṋḿ madhu oṋḿ madhu oṋḿ madhu. (One time.)</span>
			</p>
			<p>Thereafter the ácárya/ás, and following them each person present, will sip a few drops of water from their palms taken from the same pot brought by the performer of the shráddha ceremony. The performer of the shráddha will be the last to take a sip.</p>
			<p>(7) Then the ácárya/á will recite the following mantra:</p>
			<p>
			<span>Sarve’tra sukhinah bhavantu sarve santu nirámayáh;</span>
			<span>Sarve bhadráńi pashyantu na kashcid duhkhamápnuyát.</span>
			<span>Oṋḿ shántih oṋḿ shántih oṋḿ shantih. (One time.)</span>
			<span>[Let everybody be happy; let everybody be free from all physical or psychic ailments; let everybody see the bright side of everything; let nobody be forced to undergo any trouble under pressure of circumstances… Oṋḿ shántih, oṋḿ shántih, oṋḿ shantih.]</span>
			<p>A Few Directives:</p>
			<p>(1) The period of mourning should not extend beyond twelve days. If you wish, you can perform the shráddha ceremony any day within this period according to convenience. During the period of mourning you should not subject yourself to unnecessary mortification or ostentatious penance.</p>
			<p>(2) At the end of the shráddha ceremony, a gift may be made of a bull, buffalo, ram, billy-goat, or any other male domestic animal of good breed for public welfare. The animal must be male and of a developed breed. The charitable giving of animals in the shráddha ceremony is not obligatory. It is not proper that the animal should be branded elaborately. If it is considered necessary for the safety of the animal to brand it, it may be marked either on its forehead or on any hairless part of its body. The person making the charity will be responsible for its maintenance until the animal attains maturity. Thereafter, the villagers collectively will be responsible for its care. The butchering of an animal offered in charity will be considered a serious crime against the society.</p>

			<h2 class="heading">Bhukti Pradhána</h2>
			<p>Bhukti means a particular administrative area akin to a district in India or a county in Britain. The Ánanda Márga Pracáraka Saḿgha (AMPS) secretary of such a bhukti will be known as a bhukti pradhána. [Pradhána means “head” or “principal person”.]</p>
			<p>Election of Bhukti Pradhána:</p>
			<p>The sadvipras (those who are well-established in Sixteen Points(1)) of a bhukti must elect one bhukti pradhána from among themselves. The bhukti pradhána may or may not be an ácárya/á or a táttvika, but must be an educated family person. They will hold this post for three years, after which a fresh election will be held.</p>
			<p>The Bhukti Committee:</p>
			<p>The Bhukti General Committee will be constituted of representatives elected by the sadvipras from among themselves. It will consist of a maximum of twenty-five and a minimum of fifteen members. With the consent of 80 per cent of the members, the number of members may be raised above twenty-five.</p>
			<p>The bhukti pradhána will be the chairperson of the Bhukti General Committee. He/she will also form a Bhukti Executive Committee consisting of his/her chosen members. The number of members of the Bhukti Executive Committee will be determined at the discretion of the bhukti pradhána. A maximum of three members of the Bhukti Executive Committee may be sadvipras who are not members of the Bhukti General Committee; the rest must be members of the Bhukti General Committee.</p>
			<p>Duties and Responsibilities of Bhukti Pradhána</p>
			<p>In general, the bhukti pradhána is responsible for all items of the ISMUB Department - inspection, seminars, movements, utilization and boards - at the district level. They must also maintain all records of birth, játakarma, marriage, social functions, náráyańa sevá, divorce, death, shráddha and diikśádána.</p>
			<p>In addition, the bhukti pradhána should settle petty civil and criminal disputes, authorizing both the prosecution and defence to engage their pleaders. (Any sadvipra well versed in Caryácarya may be a pleader for the purpose).</p>
			<p>They are to maintain the sanctity of all jágrtis, dhvajas [flags], pratiikas and pratikrtis [photos of Márga Guru] with the help of the jágrti secretary and others.</p>
			<p>They must maintain the social solidarity of the bhukti by never allowing the individual interest of any person to go against the collective interest, and they may take disciplinary steps against a person (in consultation with their Bhukti Executive Committee) for deviating from the path of Sixteen Points.</p>
			<p>They must help with cash, kind, labour and other physical and intellectual power in materializing the different public welfare plans and programmes of Bliss. The bhukti pradhána will maintain proper accounts of all income and expenditure of his/her bhukti.</p>
			<p>The purodhá pramukha may increase or decrease the duties or responsibilities of the bhukti pradhána whenever so required with or without consultation of the Central Purodhá Board.</p>

They (samájamitrams) will be allowed to use the word samájamitram as a prefix to their names until another person of the same sector acquires this respectable rank. A bhukti pradhána retaining the status of samájamitram continuously for two years (four half-years) can permanently prefix the title to his/her name (but this will not be hereditary). A permanent samájamitram can no longer hold the post of bhukti pradhána.</p>
			<p>If a bhukti pradhána is an ácárya/á, he/she will use the word smártta [“one who has proved one’s social worthiness”] and not samájamitram.</p>
			<p>Of the nine samájamitrams, the one having the largest number of A-class committees in the world will be known as jiivamitram [friend of living beings]. A bhukti pradhána retaining the status of jiivamitram continuously for two years (four half-years) will permanently prefix the title to his/her name (but this will not be hereditary).

			<p>If the samájamitram, smártta, jiivamitram and dharmamitram are males, it is advisable that they do not shave, although this is not compulsory.</p>
			<p>The samájamitram and jiivamitram will deserve the same respect in the society as an ácárya/á. For this reason, even if it may seem necessary, no one will be entitled to take any social disciplinary action against them except a purodhá.</p>
