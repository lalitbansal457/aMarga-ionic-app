Áyurveda considers the body to be composed of seven elements, or materials, derived one from the other in the following order: rasa, or chyle (the fluid essence of digested food), blood, flesh, fat, bone marrow, and shukra (for a definition of “shukra”, please see the Bengali Glossary). The body functions on the basis of three factors, or principles: váyu, pitta and kapha (please see the Bengali Glossary).</p>

			<h2 class="heading">2. Dyspepsia (Indigestion)</h2>
	 		<p>
	 			<b>Symptoms: </b>Belching with a bad smell, watering of the mouth, distension of the stomach, loss of appetite, aversion to food, offensive internal gas, physical weakness, fretful temper, constipation or loose stool containing food particles.
	 		</p>
	 		<p>
	 			<b>Causes: </b>When we take food it is converted into a juicy mass with the help of digestive fluids, then it is transformed into blood. Blood is the most important substance in the body. Fruits, roots, leafy green vegetables and other alkaline-type foods, after being digested, preserve the vitality of the blood by increasing its alkaline portion, whereas fatty and carbohydrate-type foods increase the acidity of the blood. If there occurs a disproportionate increase in the acidity of the blood, then the spleen, liver, heart, kidneys, etc., which are our blood-purifying organs, come under too much pressure. As a result, these organs, being over-worked in purifying the blood, become gradually so weak that they ultimately fail to do their task properly.
	 		</p>
	 		<p>Since the different kinds of juicy fruits can be sufficiently digested in their own fluids, the liver bile does not have to make much effort to digest them. But in order to digest starches and carbohydrates, the saliva of the mouth must help at the preliminary stage. Chewing food brings an adequate quantity of saliva into the mouth. No sooner does the food mixed with saliva enter the stomach than the liver and the pancreas are enabled to start secreting their bile and digestive fluids. So unless food is chewed well, the liver can never function properly.</p>
	 		<p>If the quantity of non-vegetarian food is large, then the internal organs will ultimately become weak due to the increasing acidity of the blood. Then when the food from the stomach, having already been partially digested by fluid from the liver, enters the duodenal canal, the weak pancreas will be incapable of secreting enough of its digestive fluid. As a result, the partially digested food does not become completely converted into rasa (chyle). In consequence, the partially digested food gradually decomposes inside the duodenum and thereby partially blocks the intestine. This spoiled food creates a poisonous gas in the body which the respiratory system fails to purify. It also increases the acidic contents of the blood to an excessive degree. This state of health is called “indigestion” or “dyspepsia.”</p>
	 		<p>Although dyspepsia is not itself fatal, it can be the cause of several fatal diseases. And in social life, dyspepsia aggravates peoples’ acrimonious tendencies and makes them extremely irritable. Stomach, intestinal and rectal ulcers, constipation and serious dysentery may arise from dyspepsia.</p>

	 		<h4>Treatment:</h4>
	 		<p>Morning – Utkśepa Mudra, Mayúrásana, Padahastásana, Utkat́a Vajrásana, Ágneyii Mudrá and Ágneyii Práńáyáma.</p>
	 		<p>Evening – (With constipation) Agnisára Mudrá, Diirgha Prańáma, Yogásana or Yogamudrá, and Bhújauṋgásana.</p>
	 		<p>(With loose movement) Agnisára Mudrá, Sarváuṋgásana, Ágneyii Mudrá and Ágneyii Práńáyáma.</p>
	 		<p>Diet: Boiled old rice (grains a few years old), soup of green vegetables; in case of loose motion, curd (yogurt); in case of constipation, curd made from buffalo’s milk, mixed in water and taken with a little sugar. Remember that curd water is particularly beneficial for dyspepsia patients.</p>
	 		<p><b>Dos and don’ts: </b>Dyspepsia originates from unbalanced food habits. Eating when one is not hungry or only half hungry is harmful in this disease. So is eating rich food for days together, using intoxicants, eating tasty food out of greed alone, not taking rest after the meal before running off to the office, or taking a bellyful of food (according to the scriptures, it is desirable to fill the stomach halfway with food, one quarter with water, and to keep one quarter empty for free movement of air); refraining from doing physical labour and, over and above this, doing strenuous mental work or indulging in sex, is also harmful in this disease.</p>
	 		<p>It is better not to eat breakfast or any afternoon snack till the disease is fully cured. However, if one feels hungry, one can have some sweet or sour juicy fruit, particularly of sub-acid type, such as mango, pineapple, jám, any kind of citrus fruit (though citrus fruits belong to the acidic group, their action on the body is alkaline), or, in case of constipation, papaya. It is important to remember that acidic foods such as lemon and curd (yogurt) should be taken with a little water and salt.</p>
	 		<p>All non-vegetarian types of food except for small fish, are harmful for dyspepsia patients. Meat and eggs are poison. All intoxicants aggravate constipation, hence they are not to be taken either.</p>
	 		<p>With dyspepsia it is very essential to take a walk in the fresh air and to do a little physical labour every day. Sleeping in the daytime and staying awake at night are forbidden. It is better to take the evening meal before 8 PM, and a short walk thereafter is very helpful.</p>
	 		<p>Pulses are alkaline food but rich, so they are not to be eaten in cases of dyspepsia.</p>
	 		<p>It is desirable to take food or to defecate when the main flow of breath is through the right nostril. Even after food, it is desirable if the flow of breath mainly through the right nostril continues for some time. Because that is the time when the digestive glands start secreting a sufficient quantity of fluids to help digestion.</p>
	 		<p>Observing fast on Ekádashii and regulation of the diet at night on Púrńimá and Amávasyá (i.e. taking just a little milk, fruit and dry things on those two nights) is desirable.</p>
	 		<h4>Some remedies:</h4>
	 		<ul>
	 			<li>Take 1/16 tola asafoetida (Ferula foetida Regel), fried in ghee and mixed with an equal quantity of rock-salt, before meals.</li>
	 			<li>Take shredded dry coconut or the flesh of mature coconut along with a prepared betel (Piper betle Linn.) leaf or with aniseed.</li>
	 			<li>Take jámir lime sprinkled with salt.</li>
	 			<li>Take 1/16 tola (nor more than that) of ash of a cowrie, wrapped in a betel leaf, after the evening meal every day.</li>
	 			<li>For a few days take some myrobalan powder, mixed and ground with an equal quantity of aniseed powder and double the quantity of Kashii sugar (sugar refined by hand equipment and hence a reddish colour). Do not used myrobalan seeds which, if dropped in water, float rather than sink.</li>
	 		</ul>

 			<h2 class="heading">3. Hernia</h2>
 	 		<p>
 	 			<b>Symptoms: </b>When undigested food or accumulated and vitiated stool starts building up pressure, or the offensive internal gas caused by them puts a severe strain on the intestine, the intestine gets dislodged from its normal position, open a hold in the abdominal wall, and protrudes through it. This condition is called “hernia”.
 	 		</p>
 	 		<p>If the dislodged intestine comes out through an opening left in the canal to the scrotum, it is called “inguinal hernia”. When it pushes out through the hole in the canal of nerve fibres and the muscular network controlling the legs, it is called a “femoral hernia”. Occasionally it pushes out through the navel opening of children, and this is called an “umbilical hernia”. As long as it is possible to push the protruded intestine back inside or to pull it back into position temporarily through suction, this condition, through painful, does not become fatal. But if the protruded intestine becomes hard like a rope and obstructs then normal functioning of the lower anatomy, then the disease can be said to have reached the critical stage. When the protruded intestine becomes trapped in the opening, causing severe suffering to the patient, then it is called a “strangulated hernia”.</p>
 	 		<p>
 	 			<b>Causes: </b>Food enters the stomach and there gets partially digested. It then passes into the duodenum (upper intestine) for complete digestion. Too much non-vegetarian and fatty food aggravates the acidity of the blood. As a result, different hormone-secreting glands become weak, and the partially-digested food starts decaying inside the body, creating a foul and poisonous gas which, in turn, puts pressure and strain on the stool-filled intestine and forces its dislodgement. Therefore failure of the liver to digest all the food properly is the main cause of hernia.
 	 		</p>
 	 		<h4>Treatment:</h4>
 	 		<p>Morning – Utkśepa Mudrá, Ashvinii Mudrá, Mayúrásana, Padahastásana, Ud́d́ayana Mudrá and Ágneyii Mudrá or Ágneyii Práńáyáma.</p>
 	 		<p>Evening – Ud́d́ayana Mudrá, Sarváuṋgásana, Ashvinii Mudrá and Ágneyii Mudrá or Ágneyii Práńáyáma.</p>
 	 		<p>
 	 			<b>Diet: </b>Because hernia originates from intemperate food habits, special care should be taken about food – especially regarding non-vegetarian food and all types of food which may cause constipation.
 	 		</p>
 	 		<p>Hernia patients must never completely fill the stomach, in order to prevent pressure on the stomach. It is also desirable to take a small quantity of food a greater number of times, rather than to eat a large amount at one time. Drinking a small amount of water or lemon-water many times a day is also advisable. A hernia patient should also remember to maintain a slight but continuous feeling of hunger. Hernia patients should get out of the habit of straining while defecating.</p>

 	 		<p><b>Dos and don’ts: </b>For hernia patients, bending forward to lift heavy articles, jumping about excessively, over-eating out of greed and indulging in sex are all very harmful.</p>

 	 	 	<div ng-show="treatmentPageIndex == 3">
 	 			<h2 class="heading">4. Appendicitis</h2>
 	 	 		<p>
 	 	 			<b>Symptoms: </b>Swelling of the appendix and simultaneous unbearable pain in the abdominal region; fear of eating in spite of appetite or desire for food.
 	 	 		</p>
 	 	 		
 	 	 		<p>
 	 	 			<b>Causes: </b>Aversion to physical labour, spending much time indoors, not taking part in sports and exercises, constipation; such short-comings, along with overeating.
 	 	 		</p>
 	 	 		
 	 	 		<p><b>Treatment: </b>Ásanas, mudrás, diet and dos and don’ts are the same as for dyspepsia patients.</p>
 	 	 		<p>With appendicitis, fibrous foods, all types of non-vegetarian foods, atapa rice (a fine-quality, very white type of rice) and all foods that cause constipation are strictly forbidden.</p>
 	 	 	</div>
 	 	 	<div ng-show="treatmentPageIndex == 4">
 	 			<h2 class="heading">5. Acidity</h2>
 	 	 		<p>
 	 	 			<b>Symptoms: </b>Physical weakness, acidic or watery belching, dizziness, burning stomach, heartburn, etc.
 	 	 		</p>
 	 	 		<p>
 	 	 			<b>Causes: </b>Oxygen inhaled in breathing enters the body and eventually turns into carbon dioxide. Through the influence of this carbon dioxide, the digestive fluid-secreting glands are activated. If food is taken irregularly and excessively day after day, or if food is forced down with little or no appetite, or if eating rich food becomes a steady habit, it becomes impossible for the digestive fluid to digest the food properly. Then, just as on the one hand the undigested or partially-digested food turns into poisonous gas, so on the other hand the secreted digestive fluid gradually turns into harmful acid.
 	 	 		</p>
 	 	 		<p>The digestive fluids are themselves acidic, but under normal conditions when they digest food they themselves are digested. When, however, as a result of the aforesaid irregularities, they are unable to digest the food, the fluids themselves also remain undigested.</p>
 	 	 		<p>The cause of acidity, therefore, is the poisonous gas being produced by the decomposed food, together with the putrid acid produced by the deterioration of the undigested fluids.</p>
 	 	 		<p>The putrid acidic gas and fluids cause a burning sensation in the stomach. When they rise up to the chest they cause heartburn; when they reach the throat, burning is felt in the throat; when they rise further they cause dizziness.</p>
 	 	 		<p>Due to this excessive acidity, the blood becomes acid-dominated. Being overworked, the blood-purifying organs of the body also become weak, and the patient feels weak.</p>
 	 	 		<p>This over-acidity of the blood also causes swelling and consequent pain in different parts of the body, especially the joints. The name of this condition is “rheumatism”.</p>
 	 	 		<p>When a strong and continuous effort is being made by the body’s organs to purify the over-acid blood, this condition is called “colic” or “shooting pain.”</p>
 	 	 		<h4>Treatment:</h4>
 	 	 		<p>Morning – Utkśepa Mudrá, Mayúrásana, Padahastásana, Ud́d́ayána Mudrá, Agnisára Mudrá and Ágneyii Práńáyáma.</p>
 	 	 		<p>Evening – Agnisára Mudrá, Utkat́a Pashcimottánásana Sarváuṋgásana and Ágneyii Mudrá or Ágneyii Práńáyáma.</p>
 	 	 		
 	 	 		<p>Diet: In acidity boiled old rice (grains a few years old), soup of green vegetables (no vegetables fried, parched, or taken in large quantity), juicy sweet or sour fruits, and curd-water are especially useful. Curd (yogurt) alone is not particularly beneficial for acidity patients.</p>
 	 	 		<p><b>Dos and don’ts: </b>For patients of acidity it is particularly important to walk in the open air, to eat less food than the appetite demands, and to drink plenty of water, in small amounts, at intervals throughout the day. Coconut and coconut-based foods and medicines are especially useful in this disease. Patients should refrain from eating breakfast and snacks. If the hunger is unbearable, the patient may eat a little bit of juicy fruit. A frequent symptom of this disease is that, due to old habits, the digestive glands discharge an excessive quantity of fluids, as a result of which the patient suddenly feels an extreme hunger at odd times, which is called “demon hunger”. That is why we find that a patient who is often in a depressed mood about his/her disease or goes around talking about the disease to everyone, when he/she sits down to eat, eats excessively. This symptom is the result of the secretion of digestive fluids at a particular time in accordance with the old habits of the patient. It is therefore desirable to be cautious about this “demon”, detrimental hunger. An acidity patient should never violate these dos and don’ts.</p>
 	 	 		<p>If due to the over-secretion of digestive fluids the patient suffers from “demon hunger”, it can be relieved by drinking a large glass of water. When the acidity patient feels pain, it is advisable to drink orange or tangerine juice mixed in tepid water. After the pain has subsided, lemon juice in cold water should be taken. As with dyspepsia, during mealtime and for an hour thereafter breath should be flowing through the patient’s right nostril.</p>
 	 	 		<p>At the time of severe colic pain, the dominant flow of breath should be changed from the nostril through which it was flowing at the time the pain started to the other nostril. Allowing the bile to accumulate by not taking something when one is hungry should never be permitted, because in that event the undigested bile itself will become the cause of acidity.</p>
 	 	 		
 	 	 		<h4>Some remedies:</h4>
 	 	 		<ul>
 	 	 			<li>Eat some shredded dry coconut along with a prepared betel (Piper betle Linn.) leaf, or some flesh of mature coconut along with aniseed.</li>
 	 	 			<li>To get immediate relief from a distressing colic pain, equal quantities of chalk and átapa rice powder should be ground together, and 1/2 tola of the mixture should be taken.</li>
 	 	 			<li>Take with cold water 1/16 tola of the white portion of the ashes of the tamarind (Tamarindus indica Linn) pod.</li>
 	 	 			<li>Take 1/16 tola of the ashes of white ákanda leaf and rock salt after burning them together in equal quantities in an enclosed earthen pot.</li>
 	 	 			<li>As with dyspepsia, it is desirable for acidity patients to observe fasting on Ekádashii days and regulation of diet on Púrńimá and Amávasyá.</li>

 	 	 	<div ng-show="treatmentPageIndex == 5">
 	 			<h2 class="heading">6. Haemorrhoids (Piles)</h2>
 	 	 		<p>
 	 	 			<b>Symptoms: </b>If there is contaminated gas and blood in the body which cannot get out, the veins and capillaries around the anus become swollen due to the pressure, and ultimately remain swollen. When this happens it is called “developed piles”. When developed piles appear outside the anus they are called “external”, and when they appear inside they are called “internal”.
 	 	 		</p>
 	 	 		<p>When, under pressure of the Apána Váyu (vital energy controlling the lower abdominal organs), blood starts oozing out of the developed piles, they are called “bleeding piles”. But not all piles bleed. If, instead, they are painful, aching, burning or itching, they are called “dry piles”.</p>
 	 	 		<p>
 	 	 			<b>Causes: </b>Constipation due to the defective functioning of the liver is the main cause of piles, but generally no serious ailment can develop for one reason only. Like other serious diseases, piles is a disease of the entire system, so there are many other reasons for its development also. The first and foremost of these reasons is lack of physical exercise and the second is sexual over-indulgence. Straining at stool often aggravates the disease. Remember that without constipation and defective functioning of the liver one can never suffer from piles.
 	 	 		</p>
 	 	 		
 	 	 		<h4>Treatment:</h4>
 	 	 		<p>Morning – Utkśepa Mudrá, Ud́d́ayana Mudrá, Jánushirasana, Shalabhásana or Mayúrásana, Agnisára Mudrá, Padahastásana and Ashvinii Mudrá.</p>
 	 	 		<p>Evening – Agnisára Mudrá, Bhastrikásana, Sarváuṋgásana, Matsyamudrá, Shasháuṋgásana and Ashvinii Mudrá.</p>
 	 	 		
 	 	 		<p>Diet: If the patient of piles feels hungry early in the morning, he or she may eat some sweet or sour juicy fruit. At noon take a lot of leafy vegetables, or soup made from leafy vegetables, along with a small quantity of rice or fresh rut́i (chápáti – flat bread made from whole-wheat flour). Arum (Amorphophallus campanulatus (Roxb.) Bl.) curd-water, soup, figs, mána kacu, pat́ol, tomato, spinach, green (unripe) pumpkin (Benincasa cerifera Savi), squash (Lagenaria vulgaris Seringe), and núneshák are particularly beneficial. The patient should drink a glass of curd-water twice a day.</p>

 	 	 		<p><b>Dos and don’ts: </b>It is not possible to achieve a permanent cure by removing the developed piles through surgery or through stopping the bleeding by any method, because if the root causes are not eliminated, the disease may attack again at any moment, or the contaminated gas and blood in the body may cause some other disease. Therefore, though it may not be improper to employ some temporary expedient to stop severe bleeding at the critical stage, the liver has to be restored in order to obtain a permanent cure. If the liver becomes healthy, the piles will disappear without any treatment.</p>
 	 	 		<p>The patient has to be careful to have a sharp appetite at noon. With piles all extra-alkaline food must be carefully avoided. It is desirable for the patients to avoid eating plantain spathe, plantain flower, plantain fruit or meoyá fruit. At the critical stage of the disease fasting is always recommended. During fasting, plenty of water, and, if desired, sweet or sour citrus juices mixed in water may be consumed. Piles patients should not eat hot (i.e. spicy), salty or rough foods.</p>
 	 	 		
 	 	 		
 	 	 		<h4>Some remedies:</h4>
 	 	 		<ul>
 	 	 			<li> After defecation wash the anus with alum-water. If one applies slightly-warm neem ghee prepared from tender young neem (margosa, Melia azadirachta indica A. Juss.) leaves on the developed piles, the disease will be cured within a few days. It is desirable to use this neem ghee at bedtime also.</li>
 	 	 			<li>In the early morning take 2 tolas of dugdhakśiirá juice on an empty stomach. This will bring good results.</li>
 	 	 			<li>In cases of severe bleeding, drinking 1 tola of kuksiimá, or in its absence durbá juice twice a day will produce good results.</li>
 	 	 			<li>A very favourable result can be obtained if 1 tola of husked black sesame seeds mixed with 2 tolas of butter are taken early in the morning.</li>
 	 	 			<li>The developed piles will gradually disappear, if, applying a piece of shimula cotton soaked in kuksiimá juice on them like a bandage, they are exposed to the sun every day for a few days.</li>
 	 	 			<li>2 tolas of myrobalan pulverized in cow’s urine, taken regularly along with cane guŕ (raw sugar) over a period of twenty-one days, by licking it, will have a wonderful effect.</li>
 	 	 			<li>Slowly sipping old raw sugar of dates, mixed in water, early in the morning, will relieve the severity of piles.</li>
 	 	 			<li>Vyápaka shaoca before and after meals is a must for all piles patients.</li>
