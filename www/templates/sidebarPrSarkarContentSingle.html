	 						<h3 class="head_ing5"><b>1. Evolution Towards Perfection</b></h3>
	 						<div class="blog_style_AV">
	 						<p >Life is a movement from imperfection to perfection. When inanimate objects become animate there is progress. There is further progress when animate beings become multicellular metazoic organisms, more and more complicated structures. The human being is the highest being, the being most perfect in structure. The human being is thus a perfected animal. But this is the beginning of progress for humanity. Humans still have to achieve further physical, intellectual and spiritual perfection. Movement towards perfection – God – is a human’s true nature (dharma). Movement towards imperfection is against one’s true nature (adharma). The former is life, the latter is death. Human movement towards animality is therefore not life, it is death.<br><br>
	 						No movement is free from friction or obstacles. Even when you walk, the force of gravity obstructs you. Movement towards perfection is obstructed by all the forces of imperfection, of evil. The sinful, the crude, the narrow, obstruct all movement for the expansion of the human mind. But perfection being a God-ward movement, do not be afraid – move on. Obstacles will go down the drain, where they belong. You will progress.<br><br>
	 						The mission of human life is to move towards perfection, towards God. This is one’s duty. In this struggle the forces of evil are bound to be defeated. This has been the case all along, and history will repeat itself. You have no right to rest until you have fulfilled your mission of being perfect, of being divine, of establishing yourself in perfection. Rest is sin as it puts a stop to this movement. Do not rest until you have reached your goal.<br>

	 						<p >From the inanimate to the animate goes the process of evolution. Consider a piece of stone for instance. It has neither the power of action nor the sensation of mind. What is the reason? It is because hitherto there has been no manifestation of mind in the stone at all. Consider the trees and plants that are more animate than the stone. There is activity in them. They grow, draw the vital juice from the earth, maintain their species by creating seeds in their own bodies, and enjoy and suffer pleasure and pain when taken care of or hurt. We see in them the manifestation of consciousness, for mind has awakened in them. Thus progressing on the path of mental development, we see in humanity its greatest manifestation. Just as evolution takes place from the subtle to the crude, similarly the unit entity reverts step by step from the crude to the subtle, towards the same Absolute Consciousness from whence it came. It is just like the waves of the sea, rippling back from whence they have come.<br>

	 						<p >The darkness of evolutionary night began to fade centuries ago when the first ape-like creature deserted his tree-branch kingdom and shambled out into the light of the plain. He was guided by something he could not understand: something un-apelike and impossible for his comrades. Somehow, somewhere in his seething body chemistry, something had changed. In his brain lay the seed of humanity; in his strangely bright eyes, the dark shadow of a hidden dream.<br><br>
	 						Time passed slowly. The new creatures developed and multiplied. The wonderful changes in their bodies and minds continued; their brains, nerves and glandular systems grew in complexity and specialization. New behaviour patterns evolved and after some time, emotions and feelings unknown and denied to all previous forms of life found their means of expression. The Dawn of Man was reached at that auspicious hour. The waves of thought generated by that first human expression vibrate even to this day in the unconscious mind of every human being. Everyone of us carries within him the hidden memory of that first sunrise, and even beyond it into the darkness of antiquity. We are, by means of this primordial memory, which is part of our human heritage, intimately connected to all forms of life.<br>

	 						<p >Humanity, standing as it does at the top of the evolutionary ladder, may sometimes feel proud and in a weak moment commit an act of meanness. Yet one should always remain vigilant against this. The evolutionary forces have not stopped. The theatre of action has shifted to the psychic level. Evolution is now expressing its power in the daily struggle of men and women everywhere to attain dignity.<br>

	 			<h3 class="head_ing5"><b>2. The Supreme Consciousness</b></h3>
	 						<div class="blog_style_AV">
	 						<p >You know, there is nothing disorderly in this Universe. Everything moves according to certain rules. In this solar system of ours, the sun is the nucleus, and so many planets are moving around the sun. In this ethereal system, the earth is the nucleus, and the moon is moving around it. Similarly, in the atomic system also there is a nucleus and electrons move around the nucleus. In our cosmological order the Supreme Consciousness is the nucleus and so many animate and inanimate objects are moving around Him, knowingly or unknowingly. Human beings move knowingly and other animals, other less developed living beings, and also inanimate objects – even some human beings – move unknowingly, unconsciouly. The radius of those who move unknowingly remains unchanged, or even, due to their mean propensities, their radius may increase. But spiritual aspirants always try to lessen the length of their radius. They come closer and closer to the Supreme, and when they come to the nearest proximity, they become one with the Nucleus, and that is the stage of Salvation.<br><br>
	 						Now, so many entities, so many individuals are moving around Him; they have so many physical structures – long, short, white, black, learned, illiterate – but the common goal is the Nucleus, the Supreme Consciousness. There should be no shyness, no hatred, no complex in human beings because that Nucleus is the bigger “I” of everybody – that Nucleus is the Supreme Progenitor of all.<br>
	 						
	 						<span class="mantra2">Baba in Fiesch, 35</span></p>
	 						</div>
	 						<div class="blog_style_AV1">
	 						<p >In this universe there is nothing beyond the Supreme Consciousness. You always remain within His circle. Imagine that a cow is tied to a peg with a rope. The rope may be short or long, but the cow has to move around the peg. Similarly, human beings are moving around the Cosmic Nucleus. They go round without knowing that they are tied to a peg, without knowing Who is at the centre. They think that they are everything, and that they know so much. They think they are not ordinary creatures; this creates pride in them. Then, while moving, suddenly a question comes in their minds. They ask where they are going, from where is the inspiration to move coming? When this realization, this question arises in their minds, then they know that they are moving around a peg, and that they have to go towards the centre, towards the Supreme Nucleus. The day this realization comes they become spiritual aspirants and the radius starts decreasing. When the radius becomes nil, then they merge into the Supreme Consciousness.<br><br>
	 						Human beings will have to go on moving as long as they have the feeling that they and the Entity which has created them, the Supreme Consciousness at the Nucleus, are two different entities. When they realize suddenly on reaching close to the peg that they and the Entity which has created them are not different, the distance between the two will disappear and both will become one – they will merge in the nectar of Cosmic Consciousness. This is the ultimate aim of all beings, of plants, of anything which has life. Therefore, the person who comes onto the path of spiritual practice early is wise – and also fortunate.<br>

	 						<div class="blog_style_AV">
	 						<p >Now, the Supreme Consciousness is the Supreme Witnessing Entity. Whatever your individual consciousness is seeing or feeling - everything – is being witnessed by the Supreme Entity. Suppose you are imagining a rhinoceros in your mind, and that rhinoceros is moving within your mind – whatever that rhinoceros is doing you are seeing; whatever that rhinoceros is thinking you are hearing. Whatever the rhinoceros does, then and there it is being witnessed by you. No activities, no thought waves of that rhinoceros are a secret for you – you know everything. So whatever is being done in the universe is nothing but a mental creation of the Supreme Consciousness; everything is within His mind. He is the Macrocosm, and everything is microcosm. Each and every person is moving within His mind. Everything is within Him, nothing is without. So whatever is being done, He sees, He knows, He feels. This universe is nothing but a mental projection of that Supreme Consciousness.<br><br>
	 						Hence, because everything is His mental creation, so everything, everybody is His child. He is not the ruler, He is not the administrator, He is not the boss. He is the creator. He is the generator, He is the operator, He is the destroyer. When He withdraws His thought waves within Himself then nothing will remain. You came from Him, you are moving within His mind, and finally you will become one with Him. That is why I said, He being the generator, is represented by “G”; He being the operator is represented by “O”, and He being the destructor is represented by “D” – “G-O-D.” He is the GOD.<br>

	 						<p>God is the controller of that vital force which keeps the organisms alive. He is our friend Who saves us from the jaws of calamities by His affectionate and tender touch. He exists everywhere. He is present about us sometimes as sound expression, sometimes as thought or emotion, and then again sometimes as individual entities. There is not a place in the universe where His Entity is not manifest. What we apparently take to be a void is also full of His Entity. He is even where the human intellect cannot reach, and where the imagination bounds back, thwarted and baffled. In the planetary world, it is His glory that shines as the sun. The backbone of the nervous system, the praising of the dead ancestors, the truth of the sages, the controller, the friend, the sun – are all these separate entitites? No, all is He, all is He, all is He.<br>

	 						<p>There is one moon, but its reflections, falling in countless puddles of water, appear as countless moons. No new moon is born. The same moon is being reflected in many receptacles.

	 						<p>Is He moving? No, no, He is not. He lies motionless like the stump of a tree. Is He far away? No, no, He is not. He is very close. He is the Life of my life. He is within you, within me. He is within and without all and at all places. When a spiritual aspirant gets adequately acquainted with His Blissful Entity, we say that he is established in the Supreme Consciousness. At that stage both inside and outside attain unity. Mind then remains aloof from the attraction of trifles, and real acquaintance is made with the Supreme Being. While the body remains in the mortal world, the soul is merged in the Supreme Soul.<br>

	 						<p >Any energy is invisible. We see the operation and action of electrical energy through lights, fans, etc. Similarly, no one has ever seen the sun – only its action. It looks round, but from a short distance it is simply something burning. So electricity and the sun are to be felt only. The same is the case with the mind. No one can show his mind, nor can one see one’s own mind. One can only feel. Similarly, the Supreme Consciousness is only to be felt and realized. When the whole mind is filled with the feeling of the Supreme Consciousness you can hardly bear it – nor can you express the bliss. You feel it - you can only enjoy it!<br>

	 						<p >The concept of God and Satan is defective. If we accept the existence of Satan it means that there are two Gods, one God positive, and one God negative, i.e. Satan. And that challenges the authority of the Supreme Consciousness – that cannot be. So there is no Satan. Everywhere there is the rule of the Supreme Consciousness; nowhere is the rule of Satan. Satan is the centrifugal force that drives an aspirant, a human being, away from the Supreme Nucleus.<br>

He does not depend on any shelter. His existence does not depend on the compassion of any second entity.<br>

The fact is that even after surrendering everything to God, the arch enemy “I” remains. You will say, “I have surrendered everything to God.” – I, I, I! My friend, surrender this “I” also to God and then alone your surrender will be complete. All the trouble is due to this “I”.<br>

But one will say, “They say God is gracious, but I am an unfortunate fellow. I am not realizing His grace.” There are many persons who talk like this. But you know, my sons, you know, my daughters, there is no partiality in Him. His heavenly shower of Grace is for all. He is for each and every creature, but one feels His Grace while another does not. What is the reason: There is a heavenly shower of grace. But suppose you are holding an umbrella over your head. Will you be drenched by the shower? Oh, no. He who wants to enjoy this shower of grace must remove the umbrella of ego from his head, and he will be drenched by the divine shower. So a spiritual aspirant, a Yogi, must give up all his egoistic sentiments. And in the next moment he will be in the proximity of the Supreme Father.<br>

	 						<p >In simple terms, what we have to do is to return home from where we came. We have all come from the Supreme Entity, the Nucleus of the universe. We have to return to the same destination. The child has played throughout the day away in the fields, and now that evening has come, he returns home. He thinks that his father must have returned home: “Let me return home and sit near him.” When one is tired of this world and worldliness, one yearns to go back to spirituality – one’s home. And what is our permanent abode, our home? The Supreme Consciousness. Spiritual practice (sádhaná), therefore, is the process of returning home. It is a simple task. It requires no scholarship, no knowledge, no intellectual faculty, no long and tedious lecturing.<br>

	 						<p >When a knower of truth merges in the Supreme Being, his petty sense of existence loses itself, and attaining unity with the Supreme Entity, he becomes Supreme himself. Spiritual practice is the means for expansion of the soul, not for its annihilation; so absorption in the Supreme (samadhi) does not mean suicide but self-transcendence. One who has known the Supreme Consciousness becomes Supreme himself, for the individual entity takes on the very form of his object of ideation. One who has the Supreme as his object of ideation, becomes the Supreme himself.<br><br>
	 						If a salt doll goes to fathom the sea, it will certainly melt and become the sea itself.

	 						<p >The union of a spiritual aspirant with the Supreme Consciousness has been expressed with an excellent example. A river, giving up its name and identity, completely merges in the sea and thereafter cannot maintain its own existence except as the sea. Similarly, a spiritual aspirant, after merging himself in the Supreme Consciousness, can no longer think of himself except as the Supreme. Seeing the Ganges River, we can tell that is the water of the Ganges. We can tell the water of the Yamuna River, or the water of the Sarasvati River; but once they merge in the sea, we cannot separate them, nor can we distinguish the one from the other. Nevertheless they are all there. They all have lost their respective name-entities in the entity of the sea.<br>

The big “I” for all created beings is the same, but the little “I” varies – so many bodies having so many names. The big “I” is one and indivisible: for the entire universe there is one big “I”.<br><br>
	 						What is Yoga? It is to become one with that Supreme Entity. When you become one with the Supreme you are getting everything, you are losing nothing. You are losing only your little name, the name of your little “I”, and nothing else, and in return you are getting the Supreme “I”. This is Yoga in the spiritual sphere. Some people think that Yoga means a particular exercise. No, no, no. Yoga does not mean exercise; Yoga means unification.<br>

Now if the water of the pot is to be unified with that of the pond – actually, both the waters are intrinsically one – the pot intervening between the two waters has to be removed. After the removal of the pot, there will remain no distinction between the water of the pot and water of the pond – both become one. The cause of this apparent distinction between God and the unit being is this pot – the individual mind. The long and short of the whole thing is that He is infinite.

	 						<div class="blog_style_AV1">
	 						<p >Spiritual practice is the conversion of the small object into that infinite object. Now, you think that “This small body, this unit consciousness, is mine.” But when you think “That vast universal body is mine,” then you are the Supreme. When this individual body and mind is yours, you know all the secrets of this individual physical body and mind. And when this vast cosmos is your object, you’ll know everything of this cosmos, you’ll know everything of this infinite space. So your spiritual practice is the practice of conversion – conversion of small into big.<br><br>
	 						This process of conversion makes a person universal. One’s very existence goes beyond the scope of time, place and person. At that time, one becomes omnipotent and also omniscient. One knows everything without going through any book. When an individual wants to acquire any knowledge, one will have to go through practical experiences, books, etc. For the individual, there are so many worries and anxieties, so much optimism and pessimism, so many clashes and cohesions; but in the case of the Supreme there is no complex, no optimism, no pessimism; there is no question of clashes or cohesions, because in the case of the Cosmic, everything is internal – nothing is external. Everything is within and nothing is without. The entire universe is in the range of His mind, so there remains no second entity, no second individual. Thus the question of any clash doesn’t arise.<br><br>
	 						If one wants to attain peace, what is one to do? One is to convert one’s small objectivity into the infinite objectivity. There is no other alternative. Simply teaching the gospels of peace won’t give you any peace. You have to convert yourself from small into big. Spiritual practice is the practice of increasing one’s own psychic radius. When it becomes bigger and bigger, the range of mind is bigger. And when in this way the radius becomes infinite, the aspirant becomes one with the Supreme. This becoming one with the Supreme, the Supreme Union, is called Salvation or emancipation – liberation of permanent nature. Each and every spiritual aspirant should know this and attain liberation.<br>

Secondly, it wants to become one with the Cosmic Entity. Thirdly, it wants to do something noble; and fourthly, it wants peace, supreme peace, undisturbed peace. These are the four special qualifications of human beings. So Yoga is the path of progress, the path of development for each and every human being. In individual life we should practice yoga, and in collective life we should encourage others to practice yoga.

	 						<p >What is Tantra? The process of transforming animality or latent divinity into the Supreme Divinity is known as Tantra. The spiritual practice which liberates the aspirant from dullness or animality and expands one’s self is Tantrik practice (sádhaná). So, there cannot be any spiritual practice without Tantra. Spiritual practice means a practice for expansion, and this expansion is nothing but a liberation from the bondage of all sorts of dullness. Irrespective of caste, creed or religion, one who aspires for spiritual expansion, or does something concrete, is a Tantrika. Tantra in itself is neither a religion nor an “ism”. It is the fundamental spiritual science.<br>

	 						Now how to do it? In the laboratory, a theoretician won’t be able to help you in your research. You require a practical demonstrator in the laboratory. In the realm of spirituality, whom to follow? You may or may not follow the scriptures, you may or may not follow the social codes, and you may or may not follow the intellectuals. You are to follow those practical demonstrators; that means you are to follow the Yogis.

If a person starts doing spiritual practice by reading a book or hearing from another, that too is dangeous because in that case a clear conception about the goal is not formed.

If one wants to move on the path of the Supreme, one will have to dive into the ocean of the Supreme Consciousness. During this movement one will enjoy the sweet beauty of the Divine Play. Those who move towards the Supreme, their vital energy and their mind will flow in the same rhythm as the Cosmic Wave. It is not surprising that they will dance, they will laugh, they will weep – people will say that they are mad.<br><br>
	 						In Bliss, this wave of the Supreme Consciousness is to be attained in the process of meditation (sádhaná). That is why, in present or future, if anybody does this sádhaná with great determination, they will also dance, sing, laugh and weep, and thus they will move on towards that Supreme. In this way, by moving and moving, establishing themselves in morality, becoming “Sadvipras” (Spiritual moralists), in the true sense of the word, they will become one with that Supreme form of Bliss. Human beings will have to dive into this waveof the Supreme. This is the true success in life. The is the Ánanda Márga (Path of Bliss).<br>

It is possible that they may get some supernatural power, yet they cannot attain the Supreme Consciousness in that way. While sitting in meditation, if they think that the occult forces should come to them, they are simply whiling away their valuable time for nothing. A devoted spiritual aspirant never aspires for these things. Even if the Supreme should come to someone and say, “My child, take these celestial forces,” that person replies, “Supreme Lord, keep these forces with Yourself. I don’t need them. I want You, and You alone. I am restless for You and not for Your forces.” A mother tries to coax and cajole her crying son and offers him some toys to divert his attention. The child stops crying and forgets his mother for the time being. But if he persists in his effort to cling to the breast of his mother and continues crying, “No, Mummy, I want to be on your lap. I will not take those toys,” finally the mother finds no other way than picking up the child and holding him to her breast. A devoted spiritual aspirant is like this latter child. S/he will say, “My most lovely Father, this world that I see all around is a plethora of toys. They are ephemeral and will not remain for ever. Tell me, my Lord, are You giving these to me for all the time to come?” And then the Lord will be answerless, for He never gives these things for ever.

This includes the sun as well as the small ant which crawls on the earth. Whether it is a dead star or a living star, whether it is a nebula or a milky way or a galaxy – all belong to one universal family. The Milky Way is vast from one end to the other; an ant is a very small creature, but the role of both of them in maintaining the balance of the universe is equal. If one ant meets a premature death, it will disturb the balance of the entire cosmos. Therefore, nothing here is unimportant, not even an ant.

What is happening in the universe is the gradual death of one created being and the gradual emergence of another. Therefore, whatever will come, it will only be God coming in that form. No one is insignificant, no one is small, no one is low. Suppose there is a drunkard, a fallen man. You have no right to hate him. You talk with him, persuade him – if necessary scold him for his regression. All these efforts are alright, but you have no right to hate him.

	 						<p>Devotion means longing for the Supreme. Now the question arises, is devotion natural or unnatural for living beings? All the conscious or crude things we see in the manifested universe bear attraction for one another, and as a consequence, the continuity of the thought-projection of the Cosmic Mind is maintained. It is on account of the mutual attraction of myriads of heavenly bodies oscillating in the infinite space that balance is maintained in the firmament.<br><br>
	 						In this attraction, there is effort for self-preservation. The bee flies around and around flowers in quest of honey, just for the sake of preserving its existence. It can be seen that every entity runs toward that abode which is more lasting and secure and which can provide it greater and longer safety. People run after money for the only reason that they believe they can maintain their lives under the shelter of money; that is to say, money alone can save them. But they do not know that money can provide them neither permanent stability nor a securely-founded shelter. Even during the span of their lives, money will come and go several times. At times its glamour will dazzle their eyes, and sometimes it will make them cry, hunger-stricken. Not to speak of money alone, all finite objects have this characteristic. What is not infinite cannot permanently remain the object of your enjoyment. It cannot be your permanent resort, since the existence of all these finite objects is dependent on others, bounded by the limits of time, place and person. If the terrific speed with which the extroverted person runs after finite objects is introverted towards the Supreme Being of his or her life, s/he can attain the Supreme Consciousness, can achieve the Supreme State.<br><br>
	 						The world is a changing phenomenon. Therefore, it is unwise to be attached to any object in this ever-changing world. The very name and form will undergo changes with the change in time and place. The child changes into youth, the youth into the old, and the old into the corpse.

Cosmic Consciousness to them would remain Cosmic Consciousness; they would lose nothing.<br>

	 						<p>Now what is devotion? Leaving all the relative things, when mind moves toward the Absolute, that alone is known as Devotion. When the mind moves toward the Supreme Soul, the nearer it comes to Him, there is an unknowing change in it. The caterpillar does not know when it becomes a butterfly. The mind does not know how changes occur in it. Thus, one day it sees that it is no longer an individual being and hence the individualistic feeling disappears. When the mind is free from individualistic feelings, that alone is the Supreme State.<br>

So He has one shortage, one want. His Mind has been taken by His devotees. The devotee says, “So you have lost your mind. Oh Lord, take my mind, I offer my mind to you.

I want to love You because I get pleasure.” But this is not the highest form of devotion. In the highest form of devotion, the devotee says, “Oh Lord, I love You. I want to love You. And why do I want to love You? Because I want that my love should give You pleasure. I don’t want any pleasure. I love you not to get pleasure, but to give You pleasure.” And by means of this type of devotion, the Yogi comes in closest contact with the Supreme Self and becomes one with Him. When one’s love is to give pleasure to the Lord and not to enjoy the pleasure for oneself, one’s mind gets metamorphosed into the mind of the Lord. By this devotion, the Yogi gets established into the stance of Supreme Beatitude. The person and his God become One.<br>

	 						<p>In the human world it is not physical strength but intellectual power that is victorious. The physical strength of the elephant is very great, but a small man goads him with his intellectual power. It is happening in every field of the world. So when human beings entered the inner world, they found that their real wealth lay in increasing their psychic strength. And gradually, as their psychic strength increased, it came slowly into contact with spirituality. They found that behind their psychic power there was another power also working, due to which they attained psychic strength. Then human beings invented spiritual practices.<br><br>
	 						They realized that the Supreme Consciousness is everything. Then the idea occurred in their minds, What a great deal of intellect He must possess, from whom they derived their intellect! So for evolution in the psychic level, they should think about Him - ideation on Him would increase their intellect. Then the Supreme Consciousness became the object of their minds. Unlike the animals, their minds started ideating upon the Supreme Consciousness.<br>

	 						<p>When those who are guided by their own intellect and are experiencing the ups and downs of the world, realize that their intellect is very small and is unfit for performing greater actions, they then find no alternative but to merge their minds into the Mind of the Great.

That alone will be the symbol of their wisdom. When one is not sufficiently advanced one feels to perform actions with one’s own intellect; but when one is much advanced one begins thinking that one’s intellect is not sufficient for the performance of any action. This is the law of the world: that those who possess sufficient intellect say that they have none, but those who have none boast that they have a great deal.

	 						<p>After millions of animal lives, created beings attain human forms. That is why all the scriptures speak of the rarity of human life. The wise make proper utilization of all objects - this utilization alone makes the existence of the object worthy. You have achieved human frame – you must make it meaningful by your sádhaná (spiritual practice), service and sacrifice. Engage yourself in such useful pursuits that even the worst of your enemies hardly has any chance to despise you; utilize yourself in such a manner so as to have satisfaction in your mind also, that you never wasted your time uselessly on this earth.<br>

	 						<div class="blog_style_AV1">
	 						<p >What is sádhaná (spiritual practice)? Sádhaná means an effort. Effort for what? It is an endless effort to become one with the Supreme Nucleus. It is a ceaseless effort to obtain perfection from imperfection. Now, no movement in this universe is possible without encountering opposition. Wherever there is movement, there is opposition also. The result of struggle against this opposition is termed progress. The more one desires to proceed vigorously to the goal, the more one is to struggle against the opposition. Thus those who are adverse to struggle can never progress. They lag far behind, what to speak of progress. That’s why struggle is the essence of life. Those who abhor struggle, who misconstrue struggle as violence, have no place in the world.<br>

	 						<p >One who wants to attain the goal must not be too concerned with obstacles on the way. If one thinks of the obstacles, they will themselves become the goal and not the Supreme. That is why, in the field of spiritual sádhaná, one must always think of the Supreme, not anything else. While thinking of this goal, if some opposite feeling comes in the mind of the aspirant, s/he should not think of this. “From where are the obstacles coming?” This should not be the topic of discussion. “What we have to reach” - this should be the topic of discussion.<br><br>
	 						To establish the heavenly kingdom in this world, those with tireless cosmic ideation have to fight within themselves the devil of their own weaknesses and defects. But remember this “devil” is not your goal, so you are not to think of it. Whatever the obstacle in this march to the Great – there will be no compromise with it. That is why I say, this is the path of bravery, this is not the path of crudeness – and there is no place in it for cowardice. The aspirant will have to go on fighting endlessly, without pause.<br>

	 						The main characteristic of Tantra (spiritual expansion) is that it represents manly vigour. It represents a pactless fight. Where there is no fight there is no sádhaná. It is an impossibility to conquer a crude idea and to replace it by a subtle idea without a fight. It is not at all possible without spiritual practice. Hence, Tantra is not only a fight, it is an all-round fight. It is not only an external or an internal fight, it is simultaneously both.<br>

And when we consider our aspiration for development and advancement in the mental world, that also cannot be brought about without a struggle.

Thus Tantra is an asset not only in the spiritual world but even in the most material and crude spheres of life. Those who sparkle and arouse their vigour in the physical and mental realm by staging a struggle against crude trends, become superhuman in their human frames.

	 						<div class="blog_style_AV1">
	 						<p >In individual and collective life, obstacles are created by the force of ignorance (Avidya). During the struggle against ignorance, if the feeling of the Supreme be kept in the mind constantly, continuously, then the ignorance will be overcome. There are different effects of this force of ignorance:<br><br>
	 						(1) Lack of discrimination: When people are blinded by the desire for wordly objects and lose their discrimination, they forget the infinite and start busying themselves with the limited world. At that time they start thinking relative to be absolute and become confused. They start misutilizing their energy. They forget that nothing has come into this world forever. This greediness, this narrowness, this confusion of taking pain for pleasure, is nothing but the play of ignorance. For example, a dog takes a bone and chews on it. From his gums comes blood and, thinking that the blood is from the bone, he thinks the bone is more delicious and so he chews even harder – the more blood, the more he thinks he is getting pleasure.<br><br>
	 						If human beings think some created thing to be their own, it is nothing but ignorance. Someone thinks “my” money, “my” son, “my” house, etc. – they think they will become infinite by accumulating all these things. In actual fact one day everything will go far, far away from them. There will be nothing left which they can call their own. To remember this fact, to understand this effect of the force of ignorance correctly, they will have to do spiritual practices, otherwise they will be unable to escape from the grip of this dangerous force of ignorance.<br><br>
	 						(2) Ego of doership: This means to take the entire responsibility of an action on oneself. Whatever one does with the help of the motor organs, the action does not belong to the organs – without the witnessing Soul, the entire energy of the organs will be nowhere. If the eyes of a dead man look at an elephant, still he will not see, because the action of seeing has not been witnessed by the Soul. But human beings, due to their ego, think that they are the doers and get confused. The spiritual aspirant will have to remember that the light of the Infinite is reflected on his or her mind – due to this, their organs are able to function.<br><br>
	 						(3) Desire for worldly pleasure: Due to the influence of the force of ignorance, people think that by eating something they will feel comfort, by wearing something they will feel comfort, by acting in a certain way they will feel comfort. Through many different objects, they desire and hope for pleasure. Humans live to achieve Bliss and that is why they run after different objects. They do not want to understand that, except the infinite Supreme Consciousness, no object can give them endless bliss.<br><br>
	 						(4) Aversion: This is the opposite of attachment. Whenever people find an object painful, they try to substitute it with another. Many fights in the world are due to this cause.<br><br>
	 						(5) Lack of determination: One day a man, knowing that drinking is a very bad habit, made a promise that he would stop drinking and live his life in a very self-controlled manner. That day he also went, as he had been accustomed before, to the bar. With great determination, he passed the pub and then he told his mind, “Oh, mind, you are so great! I will now give you a good prize. I will drink up to the neck!”<br>

	 						<p>Prayer is also a mockery of the Ultimate Being or God. Prayer is a solemn petition addressed to the Supreme Being for certain benefits. On rational thinking, does not one’s attempt to rouse the wish of God to fulfill one’s needs appear to be a reminder to God to give one something which God had deprived one of? This, in fact, casts aspersion on Him and His law and His sense of distribution of His gifts and blessings. It is an insinuation, asking Him to reverse His law, to stop the process of reaction to one’s action, which must have kept one deprived of what one now wants. God’s law is unchangeable and praying to Him to change it, is a waste of one’s time.<br><br>
	 						Hymns in praise of God fall in the same category. They are equally ineffective and are a mere waste of time. Eulogy of God is tantamount to flattery, and prayer to begging.<br><br>
	 						Devotion to God falls in a different category altogether. It is contemplation of the omnipresent Cosmic Consciousness, and helps the devotee in the attainment of liberation from bondage and merger with the Ultimate Reality. The purpose of devotion is to condition the mind to think that it is subtle and not crude, that it is a reflection of the Cosmic Consciousness. Those who have read psychoanalysis and understand the efficacy of auto-suggestion will appreciate the inner motivation and efficacy of contemplation. The true devotees do not flatter the Supreme Being; they do not ask for any favours. The devotees’ tendency is merely to remind their minds of the ultimate goal so that their whole body, mind and soul strive for emancipation from the degrading influences which surround them.<br>

	 						<p >Today you have to create the Great Universe, and the guiding principle behind it will be that all humans are the progeny of the Supreme Progenitor, God. Thus all are His children, all should live together – all will have to live together. Black or white, literate or illiterate, small or tall, all are the children of the same Father and all will have to live together. There will be unity in the physical realm and also in the psychic realms.<br><br>
	 						But to strengthen this unity still further, there should be a common goal for all the children of the Supreme Father – the merger of all in Him. All have come from Him, and therefore all will remain together. But this is not sufficient. All have come from Him, are in Him, and will merge in Him, therefore all people will have to live together. For you, unity is the natural course, and division is unnatural. You well know that the Cosmic Energy will not long tolerate what is unnatural.<br><br>
	 						So it is natural for human beings to live together and to make a Great Universe. By not doing so, by mutual fight, all will be destroyed. This is the law of the universe (Prakrti). Thus you will have to remain united; you must create the Great Universe as soon as possible. There will be peace and happiness in the universe, and with one indivisible ideology, humanity will march ahead. Victory be with you!<br>

	 						<p>In our present environment there are many divisive tendencies splitting humanity into mutually belligerent groups. Spirituality must foster a natural affinity among people, to unite all humanity. The approach to spirituality should be psychological. Through rational analysis, humanity should appreciate its relationship with God and recognize the most benevolent kindness of that most beloved Entity. Spirituality should lead human beings to that one Cosmic Truth from Whom they have derived their souls and who is their ultimate destiny. That ultimate and absolute ideal is the Cosmic Ideal – an ideal beyond the scope of time, place and person. It is the Absolute, without and beyond relativity. It stands with Its own radiance for all time and for every entity of the cosmos, whether human being or less evolved soul. The Cosmic Ideal alone can be the unifying force which will strengthen humanity to smash its bondages and abolish the narrow domestic walls of divisive tendencies.<br>

Those who wish to foster the welfare of living beings as a whole have to embrace universalism as the only alternative. If we look upon everything as our own, the question of “mine” and “yours” will dissolve; in universalism there is no opportunity for violence, hatred or narrowness.<br>

If anyone runs short of his subsistence, others give him their own. Together, they share everything with all. Together, they stream ahead, singing their leading chorus.

Despite these obstacles, a social blending of humanity is in progress and needs a common constitutional structure to cement the solidarity of the world.<br><br>
	 						A world government is also essential to exercise effective control in certain spheres. For example, there should be only one world military force. The world government should form certain autonomous units (not necessarily national) to deal with problems such as education, food supply, and flood control. The boundaries of these units may be readjusted to reflect the development of more sophisticated communication techniques.

	 						<p>It is often heard that a particular country was never so united as during the war.

This common ideal is, however, very temporary, and disappears with the danger of war becoming less.<br><br>
	 						In our Bliss, the seed for a common ideal is sown from the very beginning of a child’s life. At the age of five, when the child has acquired only a preliminary understanding of his or her surroundings, s/he is given the ideal of Cosmic Consciousness. The entire society of Bliss is then founded on a common ideal – the goal being the Supreme Consciousness. Such an ideal will not disappear like the common ideal for facing the dangers of war, and the unity in a society founded on an ideal of the Cosmic Consciousness will be everlasting.<br><br>
	 						In our Bliss, even in the economic field there is a common ideal, as the whole property of the earth is common property and is to be shared by all members of the society.

If any member of a family seizes food from a store by application of mental or physical force, he certainly becomes the cause of misery to others. Similar is the case when a capitalist says, “We have seized wealth by intelligence and labour. If others have mental and physical potentialities they may also do it. Who objects to it?” They do not want to realize that the volume of commodities is limited whereas requirements are common to all.

	 						<p>Very often we say that a particular individual or a particular community of people is badly exploited. Then, what we mean by “exploited” is this, that they are exploited in the economic stratum. But if we penetrate deeply into the matter, we shall discover that the exploitation has not been only in the economic stratum, but also in the other strata of human existence, in different forms, on various pretexts. When there is exploitation on the physical level, it is not necessarily economic in nature in all cases; it is mostly social. For instance, the vested interests inject, at a certain stage, inferiority or superiority complexes in the public mind and at a much later stage, use those psychic complexes for social or economic exploitation. This exploitation on the psychic level is mostly perpetrated, in the first phase, through dogma.<br><br>
	 						When the exploitation in the physical sphere is directly economic in character, even the common people can understand that; they need not labour hard to comprehend it. But in the event of exploitation in other spheres, the exploited people are not even aware of the fact that they are being exploited. That is why it becomes easy for the cunning exploiters to keep them in prolonged domination by creating inferiority complexes in their minds.<br><br>
	 						And the tragedy is, that the exploited mass don’t try to understand; they even refuse to understand even though some may try to make them understand, that they are the victims of exploitation. So, this is more dangerous. When the exploitation is directly economic, the people can easily understand it; but when the exploitation is perpetrated in this socio-economic sphere or the psycho-economic sphere, the situation becomes complicated. The people feel a little aggrieved because they feel that they are being psychically suppressed, but they are not aware of the fact that the ultimate result is their economic exploitation.<br><br>
	 						Today all over the world there is greater economic awareness than before. That is why the cunning exploiters have resorted to the path of either socio-economic or psycho-economic exploitation. They have spread their trap over a vaster area, hoping to reap a rich harvest.<br>

	 						<p>Suppose you see a person steal something. If you see externally, you will see the man stealing. He should be punished. Shouldn’t he be punished? Yes, he should be punished. This is ordinary seeing. But if you apply your inner vision, i.e., intuitional sight, you see that the man was without food for four days, and so under pressure of circumstances, he had to steal. So after this inner seeing, this inner vision, you will come to the decision that we will remodel the socio-economic structure so that never is he compelled to steal under pressure of circumstances, because of being hungry for several days. When I started Bliss, I wanted the entire humanity to stand upon the strict code of cardinal principles, human values and spirituality, and when I saw everything internally I came to the decision that there are so many loopholes in the human society. Human beings came here about one million years ago but have not yet been able to form a well-knit social order. We require a strong social order. That’s why I had to create another branch of philosophy known as PROUT, through which we are to remodel the social order so that nobody is compelled to resort to immorality for lack of food or clothes or other necessities of life.<br>

	 						<p >The path that lies before thieves who steal out of need is extremely narrow. The solution wholly depends on the strong economic foundation of the state concerned and of the whole world. If anybody is to be blamed for the poverty and social injustice which leads to crime, we will have to blame every national leader in the world. Those who make beasts of people by making them victims of circumstances, to my mind, are the very people to stand trial, if anyone is to be tried and judged at all.<br>

	 						<div class="blog_style_AV">
	 						<p>The first cause of sin is: shortage of physical and psychic resources. If there is lack of physical necessities, people are not able to follow the higher pursuits of life. A person’s discrimination is easily disturbed; with a little anger even an intellectual utters crude words. Hence, due to a shortage of physical wealth, people become restless, lose their discrimination, and become brutal. It is because of this that communism has tended toward brutality. Likewise, if there is a dearth of intellectual resources and the intellectual standard of the people is not high, they may confuse dos and don’ts. An example is a riot in which an innocent little boy is killed. The one who encourages the riot becomes the people’s leader. Because the intellectual standard of the people is low, they commit blunders prompted by these leaders and become beasts.<br><br>
	 						In those countries which are backward or where the socio-politico-economic consciousness is less, immoral, political pigs in the form of leaders misguide the people to collect votes. I say, they are political satans, political pigs. There, shortage of physical and intellectual wealth causes people to become beasts and commit sins and crimes. This is common everywhere in the entire world except for a few well-off countries, and even there this is present, but less prominently.<br><br>
	 						The second cause is non-utilization of over-accumulated physical and psychic resources. It is a mental disease to accumulate money. Those who accumulate it do not do so in order to fulfill their needs. Human needs are few, including food, shelter and clothing. For instance, if a person has a fruit grove which yields 500 mangoes and there are only five family members, what will be done with so many mangoes? There is very little chance of utilization in the case of over-accumulation. If sadvipras are not vigilant, where there is over-accumulation, human beings will tend to misutilize wealth by indulging in baser tendencies. Therefore you will note – I am making it crystal-clear to you - that the wealthy businessmen and most of the idle kings and aristocrats of ancient times were generally wicked and mean-minded.<br><br>
	 						The third cause is stagnancy. This is the greatest burden, the greatest disease of the human society. This sort of stagnancy is suicidal, for the sign of life is dynamism. To solve this cause of sin, an intellectual approach does not work. Dogmatic and traditional people do not listen to reason. They have to be struck. And those who do the striking are sadvipras. The striking has to be done with a hammer. Sweet gospels will not do. They must be hit not with a hammer but with a sledge hammer.<br><br>
	 						Suppose sadvipras do not hammer them, what will happen then? Because of the unnecessary presence of stagnant individuals, the speed of others will be retarded. Stagnant people commit suicide and become the cause of death for others. Humanity wants to move ahead and these stagnant people block its way and obstruct its movement. People will not tolerate these obstructions. The duty of the sadvipras will be to hammer appropriately these stagnant people who are the burden of the society so that the path of human progress may be straight, pure, and well-constructed.<br><br>
	 						(“The Three Causes of Sin”)<br><br>
	 						One of the notable causes of the present-day crimes is the scarcity of honest people. Those who are honest try to follow morality in their private lives, but at times are forced to desert morality under the unwieldy load of poverty. In the course of time, they may have to go to court under the charge of theft. Law has nothing to do with poverty which has goaded them to steal. And if they are convicted and sentenced to imprisonment, there is no provision in law for the maintenance of their families. As a result, the children of such families will have no other way to live than to become pickpockets or have recourse to stealing; and their mothers, unfortunate as they are, will have to find their way leading to the underworld and to maintain their existence, embrace an ignoble and sinful life. After their release from jail, their husbands will be hated and spoken ill of by society and, out of sensitivity to such affronts, they will be forced to resort to stealing as their profession. In this way hundreds of families are being ruined everyday. Nobody feels their agonies or comes forward to sympathize with them. Because today humanity is not the object of concern at all.<br>

	 						<p >You will hear many a vain and assuming person speaking thus, “I need no one, I am doing well in isolation. I don’t want to concern myself with anybody’s affair and I don’t want anyone to come into mine. I don’t care for anybody.” Nothing can be more foolish than this statement. Medicines and nursing are necessary in diseases; active participation by the neighbours is imperative to burn a dead body and to do the needful preparations for it; the cooperation of the cultivators for food supply and of the spinners for cloth supply is essential. Remember, that no created being in this universe is independent by itself – it cannot exist all by itself. All of us have a supra-cosmic relation with the rest, at times prominent, elsewhere indistinguishable. In this plan of mutual relationship, even the slightest mistake or discord anywhere will raise a furor in the universe. In this mighty task of creation, the brilliantly luminous sun and the insignificant ant hold the same importance of existence, all these having combined to create the world family. In the same way, in human society, as well, the importance of a highly powerful and eminent person is at par with that of a disabled or dying patient. None can be ignored. The slightest injustice done to anyone will cause the breakdown of our entire social framework.<br>

	 						<div class="blog_style_AV">
	 						<p>It is not nature’s desire that human beings should penalize one another. Whenever some action is taken to penalize someone, a sense of revenge or vindictiveness arises in the mind of the dispenser of justice and stifles the judge in him or her. Hence, I suggest that the words “penal code” should be eliminated from the social life of humanity. If anybody, whether a judge or a common citizen, takes some sort of requital against someone else, it should be corrective, not penal. Then the offender, no matter how great his or her guilt, will have no cause for accusing anyone. Regardless of flaws in the judgement, it will not harm him or her in any way.<br>
	 						
	 						<span class="mantra2">Human Society I, 88</span></p>

	 						<div class="blog_style_AV1">
	 						<p>Human values will therefore be the basis of the penal code. Our social scripture says: first, persuade the offenders by sweet words. Secondly, use harsh words in order to convince them. At the third stage, tell them of penal measures. The fourth stage warrants the adoption of penal measures against them. The humane appeal is at the root of inflicting punishment in this way.<br>

	 						<div class="blog_style_AV">
	 						<p>In my opinion, sentencing people to capital punishment just because one cannot cure their ills is as much a crime as killing them oneself. Why is nothing done to remedy their ills? Is it not tantamount to beheading oneself to escape a headache? Rather it is the bounden duty of civilized society to cure the ills of these criminals. We shall have to deal with criminals with a humane heart and guide them out of their ills.<br>

	 						<p>As long as people do not take humanistic measures for criminals, it is only a meaningless farce to let them sit in prisons uselessly. One must remember that they are (mentally) diseased and that their diseases are stubborn. They can be cured in a short time through spiritual practices and in a little more time through other Yogic methods; but for this, too, a congenial environment is essential. And so the environments of the prisons should be more pure, more humane.<br>

	 						<div class="blog_style_AV1">
	 						<p >No matter how notorious a criminal is, s/he will have to stand trial based on the evidence and the lawyer’s eloquence, no matter if s/he is guilty or not. Criminals, if they have money, may come out unscathed through the legal intricacy with the help of a famous lawyer. And the non-guilty if they have no money, cannot appoint good counsel and are eventually sent to prison. If a thief is set free, it is a crime, no doubt; but inflicting punishment to an innocent person is a great sin – a severe dishonour of humanity.<br>
	 						
	 						<span class="mantra2">“Social Value and Human Cardinal Principle”</span></p>

	 						<div class="blog_style_AV">
	 						<p>Thus the purpose of the penal code which will be framed by the sadvipras will be to rectify and not punish a person. They will knock down the prisons and build rectification camps. Those who are not inborn criminals, in other words, those who perpetrate crimes because of some organic defects, ought to be offered treatment so they may humanize themselves. First and foremost their need is to be removed.<br><br>
	 						The significance of society lies in going all together. In the course of the journey, if anyone lags behind, if in the darkness of night a gust of wind blows out anyone’s lamp, then we should not go ahead leaving them in the lurch. We should extend a helping hand to them and light their lamps with the fire that makes us ablaze. Stop we must, otherwise the spirit of society is in jeopardy. Thus a person, whether s/he is a sinner, a sufferer, a thief, a criminal or characterless, is so quite superficially; inherently s/he vibrates with potentiality of being purified. The principle object of the sadvipras is to explore and bring this potentiality into play.<br>

	 						<p >In every sphere of life – social, economic, mental and spiritual – making human beings conscious of their rights leads to the expansion of knowledge, and the full application of these rights is called the cultivation of science. Neglected people who, for whatever reasons, have not pursued knowledge and science, should be given full opportunities. There should be no discrimination. It is true, however, that self-seeking vested interests have taken advantage of the ignorance of the people, and have taken over in every field: social, economic, psychological and spiritual. They don’t want the ignorant to receive the light of wisdom, or the low-caste to climb the social ladder, or the hungry to have square meals, or the superstitious to banish their superstitions. They do not want all people to acquire spiritual and scientific knowledge, to have equal opportunities to attain the kingdom of God. In order to remove this false distinction between the “literate” and the “illiterate”, human values have to be recognized. Knowledge and science will be as free as light and air – they will be like a free-flowing spring, keeping all alive, supplying vital energy constantly to the human society.<br>

	 						<p>In regard to intellect, living beings may be divided into two main groups – those who want to share their wisdom, and those who do not want to. The more a group favours the sharing of wisdom, the more is their social instinct; and those who do not, their collective social mind cannot develop in the proper way due to lack of mutual understanding. Humans are beings of social inclination. Persons with social spirit must always remember that those who have little strength and ability at their disposal, those who have not, by Nature, been endowed with the power to survive the struggle for life, must always be led along in companionship. The greater this effort to accompany the helpless people, the more civilized those persons are, and the more proper their judgement. They are the really social-minded individuals, who accept in warm embrace the so-called low, base or discarded people.<br>

In many cases a person may ridicule others to cover up his or her own ignorance. This egoistic feeling of superiority is detrimental to society. No matter what the education, intelligence, features, virtues, rank or age of an individual, everyone should bear in mind that the one s/he considers inferior, may excel him in some sphere.

Apologizing, after bumping a person, knowingly or unknowingly with an, “Oh sorry”, without enquiring as to what extent the person is hurt, is considered enough for refinement and this is the law of so-called civility. But we don’t find in this any indication of really sincere warmth of heart.

	 						<p>Under a capitalistic framework, [mechanization] means more misery and unemployment for the common people. Doubling the yield by using a machine will decrease the required number of labourers by half; consequently, capitalists will lay off labourers mercilessly. The unemployed labourers are ruined, bit by bit, by poverty and hunger. A few of them try to keep their souls and bodies together by indulging in theft, corruption, and other antisocial activities. This situation is certainly not desirable. No such reaction is possible in a collective economic system. There, mechanization will mean less labour and more comforts. With a double increase in the productivity of machines, the working hours will be reduced by half.<br>

	 						<p>In the present age, there are so many elements hostile to morality. In urban civilization, more people live in a small area; this is the enemy of individual morality. It is essential for the moral development of an individual to live a life of solitude for some time. The city serves as an asylum for antisocial elements, but this generally doesn’t happen in villages. In villages everyone knows everyone else, and the source of each others’ livelihood is known to all. In the city, even after twenty years, a person doesn’t know his neighbours, who may be scoundrels. Thus we have to keep aloof from the barbarity of city life.<br><br>
	 						This will not be done merely by speaking slogans like, “Go back to the village!” Employment opportunities will have to be created in the villages for the intelligentsia. The availability of a power supply and the expansion of cottage industries in the villages are the paramount needs of the hour. By cottage industries, I do not mean old and outmoded, but rather rationalized and well mechanized industries. Hence, decentralization is an economic necessity.<br>

	 						<div class="blog_style_AV1">
	 						<p >Morality is the foundation of spiritual practices. It must, however, be remembered that morality or good conduct is not the culminating point of the spiritual march. As a moralist one may set an ideal for other moralists, but this is not even worth mentioning for a spiritual aspirant. Spiritual practice in its very inception requires mental equilibrium. This sort of mental harmony may also be termed morality.<br>

	 						<p>People often say, “I follow neither a religion nor rituals; I abide by truth; I harm nobody and I tell no lies, and this is all that is necessary. Nothing more need be done or learned.” It should be clearly understood that morality is only an effort to lead a well-knit life. It is more correct to define morality as a dynamic force rather than a static one, because the balance in external spheres of life is only maintained by waging a war against all opposing forces. If the mind is pressured by an external allurement and there is intense mental disturbance, the force for internal struggle may yield; consequently the external equilibrium or the show of morality may at any moment break down. That is why morality is not the goal. Morality may disappear at any moment. It cannot be said that the moralist who has resisted the temptation of a bribe of two dollars would also be able to resist the temptation of an offer of two hundred thousand dollars. Nevertheless, morality is not absolutely valueless in a person’s life. Morality is an attribute of a good citizen and it is the starting-point on the path of spiritual practice.<br>

	 						<p >It cannot be said that the ultimate aim of human life is not to commit theft; what is desirable is that the tendency to commit theft should be eliminated. The aim of life is not that one will not indulge in falsehood; what is important is that the tendency of telling a lie should be dispelled from one’s mind. The aim of such morality is the attainment of that state of oneness with God where no desire is left for theft and all tendencies of falsehood disappear.<br>

	 						<p>The intelligent do not allow their mental purity to be stained even for a moment. To cleanse the mental sphere, force must be applied to remove the impurities, internal or external. This application of force must be a special type of action. When the impurity of selfishness enters every cavity of the mind and makes life a heavy burden, it has to be burned and melted in the fire of spiritual practices.<br><br>
	 						Such a practice is just the reverse of meanness and selfishness; it is the effort to remove any impurities, any black spots from the mind. A feeling of selflessness, of universalism is the only remedy for cleansing mental impurity. Those who are fascinated or tempted by an object can gradually rid themselves of the mental pollution arising from their selfish motives by adopting just the reverse course. Those who are very greedy for money should form the habit of charity and serve humanity through that practice. Those who are very angry or egoistic ought to inculcate in themselves the habit of being polite, and should serve humanity through that practice. Therefore only selfless service to humanity and efforts to look upon the world with a cosmic outlook can establish one in mental purity.<br>

This state of affairs is neither desirable nor proper and should not be allowed to continue any longer. Your duty will be to unite the moralists. Let there be two camps. Let there be an open fight. The moralists were so long scattered, and hence they could not fight. The united strength of five moralists is much more than the united strength of a hundred immoralists because there is an unholy alliance between the latter. Meditation within closed doors will not do. Gather strength by intuitional practices and unite yourselves against the immoralists.<br>

	 						<div class="blog_style_AV1">
	 						<p>It is customary to prefer social value to human value. The sadvipras want to strike at the root of this custom. To them, human value precedes social value. Human beings form the society, and hence human value should lay the foundation for social value. Human value means to treat the joys and woes, hopes and aspirations of human beings sympathetically, and set them on the pedestal of divinity after leading them to the Cosmic Consciousness. And if they are to elevate themselves to that sublime height, they will have to be provided with an environment suitable to their physical, mental and spiritual existence. It is the birthright of everyone to progress in their trifarious existence. It is the duty of society to accord recognition to this right of humanity. Society has failed to do its duty and that is why life is full of sorrows and sufferings.<br><br>
	 						Nobody can say for certain that no great man would have emerged from among those wayward boys whom we tend to slight and hate. The woman who has embraced whoredom for the sake of her physical existence might have grown into a noble personality if her agony had been appreciated sympathetically and if she were accepted by society. But since society has nothing to do with human values, a good number of great personalities are withering away in their embryonic stage.<br><br>
	 						The sadvipras will pick up this neglected humanity and arrange for its revival. To them no sinner is contemptible, no one is a rogue. People turn into satans or sinners when for lack of proper guidance they are goaded by depraving propensities. If their depraving propensities are sublimated, they will no longer be satans; they will be transformed into gods. Every course of action of society ought to be judged with an eye to the dictum, “Human beings are divine children.”<br>

Nowadays if you have no money you cannot expect to get honour. The poor people belonging to all other classes have to woo the moneyed people just for the sake of earning a livelihood. Human values are taboo here. Human beings are now but a medium of earning money. The rich have purchased all the brains with their money. They have bidden farewell to all their human values and at the same time they are busy playing a chess game with the lives of the other members of society. Bereft of everything, the people toil around the clock to live from hand to mouth. Those who are at the helm of society are absorbed in strife and suspicion, or in reckoning their loss and profit. They have no desire to think of humanity. In order to gratify their self-interest they are ready to chew the humans’ bones. There is no room for mercy, sympathy, or fellow-feeling.

In this new society based on Neohumanism, every person will find his or her life worth living. Human beings will get back their position of honour.<br>
